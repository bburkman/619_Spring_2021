These estimates may be produced intuitively by citizens exposed to risk of injury, or formally, for analysts considering alternative safety policies. All such estimates rely on behavioral assumptions, regarding how people perceive and respond to risks. They also rely on ethical assumptions, regarding how people should respond. The nature and validity of these assumptions are analyzed here, in order to provide a consumer's guide to techniques designed to evaluate risks and devise safety policies.}

abstract = {This paper presents an overview of the field of error analysis. Section 1 shows why discussions about human error are relevant for societal safety. With regard to safety research, it is important to predict abnormal events. At the machine side, reliability studies proved their value, but to predict failures in the human factor has been shown to be very difficult. Therefore, problems in how to define the notion of human error (Section 2) and how to classify different types of error (Section 3) are discussed. Some researchers started to use systematical classifications of human error types based on a recent, hierarchical model of human task performance. The outline of the model is presented. Examples of error analysis studies from the field of transportation research (Section 4) provide some basic suggestions on how to reduce error rates. Some conclusions on error control are given in Section 5. The responsibility of managers and system designers in this respect is strongly emphasized.}

abstract = {Sensible management of traffic safety is predicated on having reasonable expectations about the effect of various safety countermeasures. It is the role of evaluative research to derive such intelligence from empirical data. In spite of decades of research and experience, the safety effect of many countermeasures remains unknown. This sorry state of affairs is largely due to the objective difficulty of conducting conclusive experiments. Recognition of this objective difficulty should lead to the realization that in transport safety, knowledge is accumulated gradually from small, noisy and diverse experiments. The statistical tools used to extract knowledge from data should reflect this aspect of reality. One must therefore question the usefulness of classical tests of significance as a device for scientific progress in this field. It is argued that the unquestioning and all-pervasive use of significance testing in evaluative research on transport safety amounts to a self-inflicted learning disability. In contrast, it is shown that classical Point Estimation. Likelihood-Support and Bayesian methods can all make good use of experimental evidence which comes in small doses. In particular, the likelihood function is an efficient device for the accumulation of objective information and a necessary ingredient for Bayesian decision analysis.}

This has been accompanied by a heavy toll of deaths, In 1977, road accidents were the cause of 10% of all deaths and 62% of male deaths in the age group 15–25. The rates-per hundred million veh km-of fatalities, injuries and accidents (1980) were 35.202 and 416 respectively. The pedestrian fatality and casualty rates (1977) were high (20,134/100,000 population) especially among the old males over 64 (89,384/100,000 population). In the age group 20–24, casualty rate of drivers was 1256/100,000 driver (1977). Accidents were severe as well. Between 1970–1980 accident severity index was increasing with time and almost doubled by the end of the period reaching 13. Road accidents in Libya do not only represent an important social problem but also an economic one. In 1978, accidents cost the country about $160 million. The factors which affect accident rates and severity are divided into behavioural and structural ones and investigated. There is room for improving traffic safety in Libya. A comprehensive traffic safety program is urgently needed.}

The individual characteristics of age at enlistment, educational level, and mental ability all were found to relate significantly to injury when considered singly. When considered jointly, however, only education had a major effect on injury rate. In general, the results indicated that the same individual characteristics that predict poor military performance also predict risk of accidental injury. The occupational analysis identified a number of high-risk occupational specialties (occupations with injury rates above the Navy norm). With the exception of Hospital Corpsmen, all of these occupations were engineering, construction, or aviation specialties in which exposure to hazardous machinery or equipment was evident. Improved safety training and closer supervision should be considered for these personnel, particularly nonhigh school graduates. A modified life table technique was found to be appropriate for this type of longitudinal analysis where large and uneven withdrawals from the cohort occurred. Further analyses of large cohorts from high-risk occupations will be needed to understand the causal factors underlying observed differences in injury rate.}

abstract = {The report details a catastrophe theory model of the accident process with empirical validation. According to the cusp model, two distinct levels of risk can be observed for a distribution of group accident rates, one at 0.0 Occupational Safety and Health Association (OSHA)-reportable accidents per 100 person-years of exposure and one at 11.5. Changes within or between the two levels are determined by two control parameters: environmental hazard (asymmetry) and operator load (bifurcation). The sample consisted of 68 work groups from 8 Milwaukee-Chicago area sheet metal mills and foundries who completed the Occupational Hazards Survey (OHS). The OHS contributed six bifurcation variables (safety management, life stress, physical stress anxiety, beliefs about accident control, and experience) and two asymmetry variables (environmental hazards and danger). All organizations received an interpretive report of their survey responses with recommendations for accident control, and had held their reports for two to nine months at the time the follow-up accident rate data were collected. There were two additional bifurcation variables: months holding report and group size. Regression analysis determined that the cusp model (R2 = .42) was more than twice as accurate as the best loglinear or linear alternative. Accidents were successfully controlled by safety managers' attention to recommendations produced by the OHS analysis. Catastrophe theory provided some novel insights regarding the linkage between predictor variables and actual behavior. Research has shown that a substantial percentage of occupational accidents are the result of human error. In an effort to explain and predict such errors in a systematic manner, an accident process model based on the cusp catastrophe is developed and tested. The model offers several unique and useful properties: (1) It proposes that changes in accident rates for work groups are the result of a nonlinear dynamic process. (2) The distribution of accident rates is bimodal, with one model near zero and the other at some higher level. (3) Changes in accident rates are predicted from four sources: (i) ambient danger and hazard levels, (ii) variables that impact upon human performance capability, (iii) initial accident rates, and (iv) the mathematical function that interrelates those variables. (4) The mathematical model has inherent properties that allow for causal inference. Environmental and human performance factors can be operationalized as sets of more specific variables. In this application, The Occupational Hazards Survey was used to gather data from mill and foundry workers pertaining to hazards and dangers, adequacy of safety management, stress, anxiety, and beliefs about accident control. Workgroup size was included as an additional predictor variable in the human performance category. The experiment evaluated change in accident rates as a function of initial accident rates, survey variables, group size, and implementations of recommendations derived from the survey data. On the basis of the results, it was possible to conclude (1) qualitative variables and recommendations significantly impacted on accident rates, and that (2) the nonlinear model was a superior predictor of change compared to a linear model containing the same qualitative variables.}

Such a review is meant to identify and establish the significance of policy and socioeconomic variables affecting the level of road accidents. The aim is to identify those variables associated with effective policies and interventions to enable decision makers to improve the level of road safety. The variables that appear to affect the number of fatalities or injuries are: vehicle miles travelled (VMT), vehicle population, income (in its various forms), percentage of young drivers, intervention policies such as speed limits, periodic vehicle inspection, and minimum alcohol-drinking age. Viewed critically, the state-of-the-art models being used to explain and predict road accidents are still deficient. One possible approach to correcting this deficiency draws from consumer utility theory, using analytical models built on a newly constructed theoretical framework. Success in estimating such models may improve predictions of road accidents, thus demonstrating the comparative cost effectiveness of alternative intervention policies.}

The results indicate that the dangers (e.g. unguarded machine parts) were more prevalent in the factories with the higher annual accident frequency. In the plants with higher accident frequency the jobs and tasks of individual workers were more varied, less frequently repeated, less preplanned, more mobile, and required assimilation of more complex information than those in the factories with low accident frequency. When the prevalence of the dangers was normalized for these factors very few differences remained between the two groups of plants.}

Decisions which drivers make about vehicle maneuvres appear to be largely a function of the risk they perceive in the situation. Three studies were therefore carried out to investigate drivers' risk-taking behavior. The first study involved a computer simulation of a traffic intersection, requiring judgements of clearance in closing gaps. Both performance and risk assessment were measured. Strategies observed in the performance task were a function of age and sex, although no such differences were evident in the subjective risk estimates. The second study required assessment of risk in photographs of road situations taken from the driver's viewpoint. It was found that risk assessments could be manipulated by motivational instructions. The third study was similar to the second, except that a video tape-recorder was used for presenting the stimulus material. The results suggested that perceived risk falls with increasing age and experience in young male drivers. It was concluded that the assessment of perceived risk may be biased by task and motivational variables and therefore subjective reports of risk require validation by the use of performance measures.}

A number of articles have described their potential use in altering “safe” or “unsafe” behavior, however, no empirical research has been provided. The lack of research may be due to a misunderstanding of specific techniques. The article reviews basic operant principles and procedures leading to the development and use of a specific operant technique; the token economy system. A model system is provided with a hypothetical example of a safety problem. The reader is then led through the step-by-step process of identifying and altering a problem behavior. Current research programs on token economy systems in industry are also provided as supportive information.}

abstract = {Transportation systems in the industrialized world require vast amounts of economic and human resources. Most of the risks associated with these systems are due to the frequent use of private cars. This paper gives a review of the literature and psychological facts which may explain why the individual driver and modern society seem willing to accept higher risks in road transportation than in most other activities. Risky driving behavior may depend on (a) a driver's overestimation of his driving skill in a particular situation, (b) his conscious decision to drive under high risk or (c) his failure to perceive risk in a particular situation. It is pointed out that different means must be used in order to affect a change in these factors, mainly, training programs, the spread of information to change drivers' attitudes towards traffic risks, and environmental design changes to subjective risk. In general, empirical research indicates that greater risks are accepted if some kind of control is experienced in a situation and this is especially applicable to driving. Objective and subjective estimates of the riskiness of different elements inherent in road traffic seem to coincide fairly well with regard to a road's physical characteristics. But objective risks are underestimated in relation to speed, black spots, night driving, and narrow roads. The importance of these factors, and of alcohol intoxication and imitative behaviour for risk taking, is discussed. Comparisons of the estimated risks of different transportation systems and other risk sources are discussed. The attribution of the responsibility for an accident is very important for the risks accepted by a society. If the responsibility can be attributed to individual risk takers, as in car driving, society is willing to accept higher risk levels. Finally, the prevailing within-system perspective on risks in road transportation is contrasted with the more important and difficult global perspective which puts the risks of the road transportation system in a societal context.}

abstract = {United States traffic fatalities dropped dramatically from 49,301 in 1981 to an estimated 43,721 in 1982. Fatalities are at their lowest level in 20 yr, and fatalities per mile of travel are the lowest ever recorded. A decrease of similar magnitude occurred only in 1974, when the oil crisis, the national 55 mph speed limit, and depressed economic conditions disrupted the nation's driving habits. In 1982 the potential explanations are more difficult to observe and test. This paper examines several factors which may have contributed to the 1982 changes, including alcohol programs, occupant restraint use, demographic shifts, economic conditions, and travel patterns. Each factor's effect is assessed, though available data do not permit precise quantification. Implications of these findings for 1983 and beyond are discussed.}

The results indicate that injuries in India may be as much of a health problem for individuals 5 yr old and above as in the high income countries.}

abstract = {This paper, presented in two parts, assesses the potentialities and limitations of the deviation concept as applied to occupational accident control. A systems variable is classified as a deviation when its value falls outside a norm. In Part I, a systems model of accidents that incorporates the deviation concept is presented. Theories, models, terms, and taxonomies of the occupational accident research literature are analyzed in relation to this model in order to identify general elements. Theoretical and methodological problems concerning the definition of norms and taxonomies of deviations are discussed. In Part II measures of the significance of deviations with respect to the risk of accidents and criteria for the assessment of methods for the collection of data on deviations are operationalized. Empirical research on relations between deviations and accidents and on methods for data collection are reviewed on the basis of these measures and criteria. It is concluded that the deviation concept provides a valid basis for the design of information systems for the efficient control of accidents in production systems in operation. Considerations for the design of information systems for the collection, storing, processing, and feedback of information on deviations for accident prevention purposes are discussed.}

A self-administered questionnaire including 80 variables was used to collect data from the workers. The study population consisted of 207 workers at nine work places. The survey response rate was 93% (193 workers). The attitudes of coworkers, and judgments and attentiveness had a statistically highly significant effect on the worker's own attitude. The attitudes of supervisors, attitudes of coworkers, and the manner of instructing had a statistically highly significant effect on the performance feedback. The workers felt that the establishment of safe work habits would be most affected by the road supervisor's management methods and feedback. A considerable proportion of the workers believed that risk taking was part of their job.}

abstract = {Nigerian Coal Corporation started operations in 1916 and in October 1977 introduced full mechanization at its coal mine in Enugu. An appraisal of the mining accidents between 1975–1980 showed an overall downward trend following mechanization, from 1073 per 1000 in 1975 to 425 in 1980 (a 60% reduction). The underground accidents were reduced from a monthly average of 63 to 26 but those at the surface remained basically unaffected. Changes were also recorded in sickness absences indices, with the most significant occurring with respect to the severity index which dropped from 9.2 in 1975 to 3.0 in 1980. The distribution of injury remained essentially the same except that injuries to the upper limbs became more common than the more serious pelvic injury prior to mechanization. The impact of mechanization in industries in developing countries are discussed and ways of ensuring optimum benefits from this transfer of technology suggested.}
