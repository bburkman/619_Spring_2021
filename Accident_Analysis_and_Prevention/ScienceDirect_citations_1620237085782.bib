abstract = {Purpose
Safety climate, which is defined as workers’ shared perceptions of organizational policies, procedures, and practices as they relate to the true or relative value and importance of safety within an organization, is one of the best indicators of organizational safety outcomes. This study identifies key drivers of safety climate from the perspective of leader-member exchange (LMX). LMX is a theory describing the nature and processes of social interactions between a supervisor and a subordinate. This study examines the impact of individual drivers and combinations of drivers on safety climate through Bayesian Network simulations to predict practices which most effectively improve safety climate in the trucking industry.
Method
Survey data were collected from 5083 truck drivers in a large U.S. trucking company. Bayesian Network analysis was used to identify key drivers (factors) of safety climate and the best joint strategies for improvement. The impact of the drivers on safety climate was assessed and the simulation identified their potential impact independently and in concert with other drivers.
Results
The results from Bayesian Network analyses showed that the effects of LMX on organization- and group-level safety climate were conditionally dependent on four other drivers including psychological ownership, supervisory integrity, situation awareness, and safety communication. Among the five contributing factors, supervisory integrity and LMX had the strongest independent effects on organization- and group-level safety climate. Moreover, the results indicated that the best two joint strategies for promoting organizational (company/top management level) safety climate were LMX and psychological ownership as well as LMX and situation awareness, whereas the best two joint strategies for improving group (workgroup/supervisor level) safety climate were joint optimization of LMX and safety communication as well as LMX and psychological ownership.
Implications
Based on the study results, the strategies that may have the most potential to improve trucking safety climate are: enhancing leaders' ability to engage in high-quality exchanges (e.g., caring about employees), developing training to encourage employees/leaders to deliver on promises, and providing employees with more autonomy to enhance their ownership.}

abstract = {Hotspot identification (HSID) is one of the most important components in the highway safety management process. Previous research has found that hazardous sites identified with different methods are not consistent. It is therefore necessary to evaluate the performance of various HSID methods. The existing evaluation criteria are limited to two consecutive periods, and do not consider the temporal instability of crashes. In addition, one existing criterion does not precisely evaluate HSID method under given circumstances. This paper proposed three generalized criteria to evaluate the performance of HSID methods: (1) High Crashes Consistency Test (HCCT) is proposed to evaluate HSID methods in terms of their reliabilities of identifying sites with high crash counts; (2) Common Sites Consistency Test (CSCT) is proposed to gauge HSID methods in consistently identifying a set of common sites as hazardous sites; and, (3) Absolute Rank Differences Test (ARDT) is proposed to measure the consistency of HSID methods in measuring the absolute differences in rankings. Further, three commonly used HSID methods are applied to estimate crashes on Texas rural two-lane roadway segments with eight years of crash data. The performance of these three HSID methods were evaluated to validate the proposed criteria. Comparisons between the existing criteria and the generalized criteria revealed that: (1) the generalized criteria are capable of evaluating different HSID methods over multiple periods; and (2) the generalized criteria are enhanced with a consistent result and with less discrepancy in scores of the best identified HSID method.}

abstract = {This paper proposes a machine learning approach, the random survival forest (RSF) for competing risks, to investigate highway-rail grade crossing (HRGC) crash severity during a 29-year analysis period. The benefits of the RSF approach are that it (1) is a special type of survival analysis able to accommodate the competing nature of multiple-event outcomes to the same event of interest (here the competing multiple events are crash severities), (2) is able to conduct an event-specific selection of risk factors, (3) has the capability to determine long-term cumulative effects of contributors with the cumulative incidence function (CIF), (4) provides high prediction performance, and (5) is effective in high-dimensional settings. The RSF approach is able to consider complexities in HRGC safety analysis, e.g., non-linear relationships between HRGCs crash severities and the contributing factors and heterogeneity in data. Variable importance (VIMP) technique is adopted in this research for selecting the most predictive contributors for each crash-severity level. Moreover, marginal effect analysis results real several HRGC countermeasures’ effectiveness. Several insightful findings are discovered. For examples, adding stop signs to HRGCs that already have a combination of gate, standard flashing lights, and audible devices will reduce the likelihood of property damage only (PDO) crashes for up to seven years; but after the seventh year, the crossings are more likely to have PDO crashes. Adding audible devices to crossing with gates and standard flashing lights will reduce crash likelihood, PDO, injury, and fatal crashes by 49 %, 52 %, 46 %, and 50 %, respectively.}

Previous studies show that profound understanding of human drivers’ capability to interpret and anticipate traffic situations is required in order to provide similar capacities for automated driving technologies. There is currently not enough a priori understanding of these anticipatory capacities for safe driving applicable to any given driving situation. To enable the development of safer, more economical, and more comfortable automated driving experience, expert drivers’ anticipations and related uncertainties were studied on public roads. First, driving instructors’ expertise in anticipating traffic situations was validated with a hazard prediction test. Then, selected driving instructors drove in real traffic while thinking aloud anticipations of unfolding events. The results indicate sources of uncertainty and related adaptive and social behaviors in specific traffic situations and environments. In addition, the applicability of these anticipatory capabilities to current automated driving technology is discussed. The presented method and results can be utilized to enhance automated driving technologies by indicating their potential limitations and may enable improved situation awareness for automated vehicles. Furthermore, the produced data can be utilized for recognizing such upcoming situations, in which the human should take over the vehicle, to enable timely take-over requests.}

This has, in recent years, become a more severe problem than that caused by passenger vehicle-involved crashes. More studies need to be conducted in order to investigate factors that impact the severity of truck-involved crashes within specific scenarios. This study identifies and evaluates the factors that affect the severity of the truck-involved crashes at cross and T-intersections in North Carolina from 2005 to 2017. A latent class clustering for data segmentation is implemented to mitigate unobserved heterogeneity inherent in the crash data. Four partial proportional odds models, which include fixed and unfixed parameters, are developed considering the heterogeneous and ordinal nature inherent in severities. Estimated parameters and marginal effects are further investigated for better interpreting the impacts. Results show heterogeneous explanatory variables and associated coefficients for different classes and severity levels, which indicate the superiority of this combined approach to obtaining more specific factors and accurate coefficients that are estimated in different scenarios. Many factors are found to contribute to the severities, and crossroad scenarios are found to be more severe than T-intersections. The top five driving behaviors at intersections that contribute to the severity include disregarded signs, improper lane use, followed too closely, ignored signals, and failure to yield. These behaviors arouse a necessity to amend the traffic laws and strengthen drivers’ education while giving further insights to engineering practitioners and researchers.}

Data exploited herein are collected from a sophisticated platform that uses smartphone device sensors during a naturalistic driving experiment, at which the driving behavior from a sample of two hundred (200) drivers during 7-months is continuously recorded in real time. The main driving behavior analytics taken into consideration for the driving assessment include distance travelled, acceleration, braking, speed and smartphone usage. The analysis is performed using statistical, optimization and machine learning techniques. The driver’s safety efficiency index is estimated both in total and in several consecutive time windows to allow for the investigation of safety efficiency evolution in time. Initial data analysis results to the most critical components of microscopic driving behaviour evolution, which are used as inputs in the k-means algorithm to perform the clustering analysis. The main driving characteristics of each cluster are identified and lead to the conclusion that there are three main driving groups of the a) moderate drivers, b) unstable drivers and c) cautious drivers.}

abstract = {Rationale
Car-driving performance is negatively affected by the intake of alcohol, tranquillizers, sedatives and sleep deprivation. Although several studies have shown that the standard deviation of the lateral position on the road (SDLP) is sensitive to drug-induced changes in simulated and real driving performance tests, this parameter alone might not fully assess and quantify deviant or unsafe driving.
Objective
Using machine learning we investigated if including multiple simulator-derived parameters, rather than the SDLP alone would provide a more accurate assessment of the effect of substances affecting driving performance. We specifically analysed the effects of alcohol and alprazolam.
Methods
The data used in the present study were collected during a previous study on driving effects of alcohol and alprazolam in 24 healthy subjects (12 M, 12 F, mean age 26 years, range 20–43 years). Various driving features, such as speed and steering variations, were quantified and the influence of administration of alcohol or alprazolam was assessed to assist in designing a predictive model for abnormal driving behaviour.
Results
Adding additional features besides the SDLP increased the model performance for prediction of drug-induced abnormal driving behaviour (from an accuracy of 65 %–83 % after alprazolam intake and from 50 % to 76 % after alcohol ingestion). Driving behaviour influenced by alcohol and alprazolam was characterised by different feature importance, indicating that the two interventions influenced driving behaviour in a different way.
Conclusion
Machine learning using multiple driving features in addition to the state-of-the-art SDLP improves the assessment of drug-induced abnormal driving behaviour. The created models may facilitate quantitative description of abnormal driving behaviour in the development and application of psychopharmacological medicines. Our models require further validation using similar and unknown interventions.}

abstract = {The study aims to identify relevant variables to improve the prediction performance of the crash injury severity (CIS) classification model. Unfortunately, the CIS database is invariably characterized by the class imbalance. For instance, the samples of multiple fatal injury (MFI) severity class are typically rare as opposed to other classes. The imbalance phenomenon may introduce a prediction bias in favour of the majority class and affect the quality of the learning algorithm. The paper proposes an ensemble-based variable ranking scheme that incorporates the data resampling. At the data pre-processing level, majority weighted minority oversampling (MWMOTE) is employed to treat the imbalanced training data. Ensemble of classifiers induced from the balanced data is used to evaluate and rank the individual variables according to their importance to the injury severity prediction. The relevant variables selected are then applied to the balanced data to form a training set for the CIS classification modelling. An empirical comparison is conducted through considering the variable ranking by: 1) the learning of single inductive algorithm with imbalanced data where the relevant variables are applied to the imbalanced data to form the training data; 2) the learning of single inductive algorithm with MWMOTE data and the relevant variables identified are applied to the balanced data to form the training data; and 3) the learning of ensembles with imbalanced data where the relevant variables identified are applied to the imbalanced data to form the training data. Bayesian Networks (BNs) classifiers are then developed for each ranking method, where nested subsets of the top ranked variables are adopted. The model predictions are captured in four performance indicators in the comparative study. Based on three-year (2014–2016) crash data in Ghana, the empirical results show that the proposed method is effective to identify the most prolific predictors of the CIS level. Finally, based on the inference results of BNs developed on the best subset, the study offers the most probable explanations to the occurrence of MFI crashes in Ghana.}

abstract = {Motorcycles and motorcyclists have a variety of attributes that have been found to be a potential contributor to the high liability of vulnerable road users (VRUs). Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) that include pedestrians, bicyclists, cycle-rickshaw occupants, and motorcyclists constitute by far the highest share of road traffic accidents in developing countries. Motorized three-wheeled Rickshaws (3W-MR) is a popular public transport mode in almost all Pakistani cities and is used primarily for short trips to carry passengers and small-scale goods movement. Despite being an important mode of public transport in the developing world, little work has been done to understand the factors affecting the injury severity of three-wheeled motorized vehicles. Crash injury severity prediction is a promising research target in traffic safety. Traditional statistical models have underlying assumptions and predefined associations, which can yield misleading results if flouted. Machine learning(ML) is an emerging non-parametric method that can effectively capture the non-linear effects of both continuous and discrete variables without prior assumptions and achieve better prediction accuracy. This research analyzed injury severity of three-wheeled motorized rickshaws (3W-MR) using various machine learning-based identification algorithms, i.e., Decision jungle (DJ), Random Forest (RF), and Decision Tree (DT). Three years of crash data (from 2017 to 2019) was collected from Provincial Emergency Response Service RESCUE 1122 for Rawalpindi city, Pakistan. A total of 2,743 3W-MR crashes were reported during the study period that resulted in 258 fatalities. The predictive performance of proposed ML models was assessed using several evaluation metrics such as overall accuracy, macro-average precision, macro-average recall, and geometric means of individual class accuracies. Results revealed that DJ with an overall accuracy of 83.7 % outperformed the DT and RF-based on a stratified 10-fold cross-validation approach. Finally, Spearman correlation analysis showed that factors such as the lighting condition, crashes involving young drivers (aged 20–30 years), facilities with high-speed limits (over 60 mph), weekday, off-peak, and shiny weather conditions were more likely to worsen injury severity of 3W-MR crashes. The outcomes of this study could provide necessary and essential guidance to road safety agencies, particularly in the study area, for proactive implementation of appropriate countermeasures to curb road safety issues pertaining to three-wheeled motorized vehicles.}

For example, rear-end and side-swipe crashes are typically caused by improper vehicle interaction such as sudden lane-changing or speed control while hit-object crashes are likely the result of a single driver’s mistake. This study investigated the impact of vehicles travelling as a group (platoon) and its configuration (i.e., types of vehicles consisting of the platoon) on crash type and severity since the vehicles could affect each other when travelling in close proximity. This study applied Generalized Structure Equation Modeling (GSEM) to capture the complex relationships among the various crash factors such as traffic condition, driver characteristics, environmental conditions, and vehicle interaction to the crash attributes including type and severity. This study collected over 3 million individual vehicle data from 39 traffic count sites in California to estimate the vehicle interactions and driving behaviors. The microscopic traffic data are matched to 1417 crash reports. Results showed that vehicles traveling in platoons are associated with more rear-end and side-swipe crashes. Speed difference in the platoon had a positive effect on hit-object crashes if the platoon comprises vehicles of homogeneous type – either trucks or non-trucks. In addition, human factors such as age and gender were identified as significant influential factors in all type of crashes, however truck involvement particularly played an important role amongst side-swipe crashes. Crash severity was negatively affected by total flow, and rear-end crashes were more likely to be severe compared with hit-object crashes. Based on findings, this study suggests practical operational strategies to reduce traffic instability associated with platooned vehicle patterns. Understanding the high-risk factors for different crash types and severities would provide valuable insights for decision-makers and transportation engineers to develop targeted intervention strategies in consideration of road users and traffic conditions such as fleet mix and speed.}

An increasing number of driver assistance systems are already available in today’s automobiles; many of which are expected to become standard. Therefore, synthesizing the available evidence specific to the safety of AVTs is critical. The goal of this scoping review was to summarize this evidence with a focus on AVTs that require some driver oversight (i.e., Levels 0–3 as per the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) levels of automation taxonomy). A scoping review of research literature on AVTs was conducted for studies up to March 2018. Inclusion criteria consisted of: any study with empirical data of AVTs that included male and female drivers aged 16 years and older, healthy people (i.e., without impairments), passenger vehicles, driving simulators and/or large databases with road safety information that could be analyzed for the purpose of examining AVTs (SAE Levels 0–3), as well as measures of driving outcomes. A total of 324 peer-reviewed studies from 25 countries met the inclusion criteria for this review with over half published in the last 5 years. Data was extracted and summarized according to the following categories: measures used to evaluate the effect of AVTs on road safety (objective) and driver perceptions of the technology (subjective), testing environment, and study populations (i.e., driver age). The most commonly reported objective measures were longitudinal control (50 %), reaction time (40 %), and lateral position (23 %). The most common subjective measures were perceptions of trust (27 %), workload (20 %), and satisfaction (17 %). While most studies investigated singular AVTs (237 of 324 studies), the number of studies after 2013 that examined 2 or more AVTs concurrently increased. Studies involved drivers from different age groups (51 %) and were conducted in driving simulators (70 %). Overall, the evidence is generally in favour of AVTs having a positive effect on driving safety, although the nature and design of studies varied widely. Our examination of this evidence highlights the opportunities as well as the challenges involved with investigating AVTs. Ensuring such technologies are congruent with the needs of drivers, particularly younger and older driver age groups, who are known to have a higher crash risk, is critical. With automotive manufacturers keen to adopt the latest AVTs, this scoping review highlights how testing of this technology has been undertaken, with a focus on how new research can be conducted to improve road safety now and in the future.}

abstract = {Non-motorists involved in rail-trespassing crashes are usually more vulnerable to receiving major or fatal injuries. Previous research has used traditional quantitative crash data for understanding factors contributing to injury outcomes of non-motorists in train involved collisions. However, usually overlooked crash narratives can provide useful and unique contextual crash-specific information regarding factors associated with injury outcomes. The main objective of this study is to harness the rapid advancements in more sophisticated qualitative analysis procedures for identifying thematic concepts in unstructured crash narrative data. A two-staged hybrid approach is proposed where text mining is applied first to extract valuable information from crash narratives followed by inclusion of the new variables derived from text mining in formulation of advanced statistical models for injury outcomes. By using ten-year (2006−2015) non-motorist non-crossing trespassing injury data obtained from the Federal Railroad Administration, statistical procedures and advanced machine learning text analytics are applied to extract unique information on contributory factors of trespassers’ injury outcomes. The key concepts are systematically categorized into trespasser, injury, train, medical, and location related factors. A total of 13 unique variables are extracted from the thematic concepts that are not present in traditional tabular crash data. The analysis reveals a positive statistically significant association between presence of crash narrative and trespasser’s injury outcome (coded as minor, major, and fatal injury). Compared to crashes with minor injuries, crashes involving major and fatal injuries are more likely to be reported with crash narratives. A crosstabulation of new variables derived from text mining with injury outcomes revealed that trespassers with confirmed suicide attempts, trespassers wearing headphones, or talking on cell phones are more likely to receive fatal injuries. Among other factors identified, trespassers under alcohol influence, trespasser hit by commuter train, and advance warnings by engineer are associated with more severe (major and fatal) trespasser injury outcomes. Accounting for unobserved heterogeneity and controlling for other factors, fixed and random parameter discrete outcome models are developed to understand the heterogeneous correlations between trespasser injury outcomes and the new crash specific explanatory variables derived from text mining – providing deeper insights. Practical implications and future research directions are discussed.}

Specifically, a safety prediction model provides a decision reference for the trajectory planning system in the pre-crash phase and the adaptive restraint system in the in-crash phase. The main goal of the current study is to construct a data-driven, vehicle kinematic feature-based model to realize accurate and near real-time prediction of in-vehicle occupant injury severity. A large-scale numerical database was established focusing on occupant kinetics. A first-step deep-learning model was established to predict occupant kinetics and injury severity using a convolutional neural network (CNN). To reduce the computational time for real-time application, the second step was to extract simplified kinematic features from vehicle crash pulses via a feature extraction method, which was inspired by a visualization approach applied to the CNN-based model. The features were incorporated with a low-complexity machine-learning algorithm and achieved satisfactory accuracy (85.4 % on the numerical database, 78.7 % on a 192-case real-world dataset) and decreased computational time (1.2 ± 0.4 ms) on the prediction tasks. This study demonstrated the feasibility of using data-driven and feature-based approaches to achieve accurate injury risk estimation prior to collision. The proposed model is expected to provide a decision reference for integrated safety systems in the next generation of automated vehicles.}

abstract = {Adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) is a promising technique to improve the efficiency of signalized intersections, especially in the era of connected vehicles (CVs) when real-time information on vehicle positions and trajectories is available. Numerous ATSC algorithms have been proposed to accommodate real-time traffic conditions and optimize traffic efficiency. The common objective of these algorithms is to minimize total delay, decrease queue length, or maximize vehicle throughput. Despite their positive impacts on traffic mobility, the existing ATSC algorithms do not consider optimizing traffic safety. This is most likely due to the lack of tools to evaluate safety in real time. However, recent research has developed various real-time safety models for signalized intersections. These models can be used to evaluate safety in real time using dynamic traffic parameters, such as traffic volume, shock wave characteristics, and platoon ratio. Evaluating safety in real time can enable developing ATSC strategies for real-time safety optimization. In this paper, we present a novel self-learning ATSC algorithm to optimize the safety of signalized intersections. The algorithm was developed using the Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach and was trained using the simulation platform VISSIM. The trained algorithm was then validated using real-world traffic data obtained from two signalized intersections in the city of Surrey, British Columbia. Compared to the traditional actuated signal control system, the proposed algorithm reduces traffic conflicts by approximately 40 %. Moreover, the proposed ATSC algorithm was tested under various market penetration rates (MPRs) of CVs. The results showed that 90 % and 50 % of the algorithm’s safety benefits can be achieved at MPR values of 50 % and 30 %, respectively. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first self-learning ATSC algorithm that optimizes traffic safety in real time.}

abstract = {Real-time driving risk status prediction is critical for developing proactive traffic intervention strategies and enhance driving safety. However, the optimal observation time window length and prediction time window length, which should be the prerequisite for the timeliness and accuracy of real-time driving risk status prediction model, have been rarely explored in previous studies. In this study, a methodology which integrates driving risk status identification, rolling time window-based feature extraction, real-time driving risk status prediction and driving risk influencing factors analysis was proposed to accurately evaluate and predict real-time driving risk status. The methodology was tested based on 1,440 car-following events from Shanghai Naturalistic Driving Study. Results show that four driving risk statuses (safe, low-risk, median-risk and high-risk) are most appropriate to establish risk labelling criteria. In addition, results from driving risk status prediction show that when the observation time window length is 0.5 s, the accuracy rate of predicting medium-risk or high-risk status occurring in the next 0.7 s is higher than 85 % using multi-layer perceptron model. Meanwhile, the results from the analysis of influencing factors show that the input variables related to the risk status score higher in the ranking of feature importance. A part from that, speed difference, headway distance, speed and acceleration are still important in predicting driving risk status. The proposed methods in this paper can be applied in connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) to reduce driver cognitive workload and hence improve driving safety fed with naturalistic driving data collected using in-vehicle systems.}

However, due to the insufficient understanding of the human driving strategy and style, the conflicts between ICVs and human drivers have arisen public attention, threatening the road safety and bottlenecking the development of ICV. In order to embed the human driving strategy in the intelligent driving system, researchers have been rolling out efforts on driver modeling. Most driver models, however, still suffer from the limited application scope or poor transparency. Within our finite horizons, a unified and readable driver model for various driving scenarios is generally unobtainable. In this work, we tried to model the human driving strategy from an aspect of human nature, that is, the way human drivers respond to the driving risk. We employed the risk field theory (also known as the safety field theory) to model the environmental risk in a comprehensive manner. By studying the risk-response strategy from the driving data of 24 human drivers, we proposed a unified structure, which we call the risk-response driver model (RRDM), to model the human driving strategy. This model provides access to learning not only the average driving strategy of a group of human drivers but also the specific driving style of a single driver. The explicit and readable driving strategy produced by RRDM can be directly employed to reproduce human-like longitudinal driving control. We verified the performance of our model in car-following tasks and found that its human-like driving performance is recoverable among the human drivers who participated in the tests.}

From 2015–2019, there were 57 HRGC crashes at crossings in East Baton Rouge Parish (EBRP), resulting in thirteen injuries with $346,875 cost of vehicle damages. Consolidation programs help to close redundant crossings and thereby decrease the crash risks; however, it is difficult to find the best crossing in a neighborhood for closure. In our previous research working on HRGC consolidation models in 2019, from among four Machine Learning algorithms, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGboost) performed better in HRGC prediction models. In continuation of our previous studies on developing a HRGC prediction model, this research employed Text Mining Techniques, and Geospatial Analysis in addition to the XGboost Machine Learning algorithm. The aim was to develop a consolidation model that is customized for local implementation. The results indicated an overall accuracy of 88 % for the proposed model. The relative importance of the variables input to the model was also reported and offers an in-depth understanding of the model’s behavior. Considering the different correlation threshold, a sensitivity analysis was also performed on different aggregation gain values. Subsequently, it resulted in the development of a simplified model utilizing 14 variables, with aggregated gain values of 95 % and a correlation threshold of 0.5. Based on this model, 15 % of current highway-rail grade crossings should be closed.}

Utilizing crash data collected from fifteen states in the United States for the period 2013–2017, the association between distracted driving crash severity and various built environment indicators was examined by the generalized ordered logit regression model. The results show that at a lower severity level, DD related crashes were found to be less severe at roundabouts or in urban areas, whereas the probability of injuries rather than property damage only (PDO) increases if an accident involves speeding or when occurring at an intersection or a curved road. Comparatively, at a higher severity level, the odds of severe (or fatal) injury involvement compared to minor injuries and PDO was found to be higher in a work-zone, a curved roadway, or when excessive speed was involved. Conversely, roundabouts and urban areas affected negatively in severe DD crash, which is consistent with the lower-level case. The study also reveals a state-specific variability of the influence of the built environment on the severity of DD related crashes. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the severity of DD related crashes for transportation safety planners or policymakers to develop customized policy recommendations, such as designing policies or roadway safety treatments, to curb the negative consequences of distracted driving.}

abstract = {Run-off the road crashes account for a significant proportion of severe injuries to vehicle occupants. Traffic barriers have been installed with an objective to keep vehicles on the roadway, and prevent them from hitting natural obstacles like trees or boulders. However, still injuries and fatalities of barrier crashes account for high proportion of fatalities on roadway. Due to challenging geometrics characteristics of Wyoming’s roadway, a high mileage of barriers has been installed in the state. The high mileages of barriers result in a high number of barrier crashes in terms of crash frequency and severity due to high exposure. Previous studies mainly focused on crash frequency or individual crash severity. However, it has been recognized the importance of accounting for both aspects of crash severity, and crash frequency. So, in this study, crashes are aggregated across different barriers, and those crashes were converted into costs by considering the impacts of both crash severity and frequency. However, one of the main challenges of this type of dataset is highly skewness of crash data due to its sparseness nature. An improper use of model distribution of crash cost would result in biased estimations of the covariates, and erroneous results. Thus, in order to address this issue, a semi-parametric method of quantile regression technique was implemented to account for the skewness of the response by relaxing model distribution parameters. Also, to account for the heterogeneity in the dataset due to barriers' types, a random intercept model accounting for the structure of the data was implemented. In addition, interaction terms between significant predictors were considered. Understanding what factors with which magnitude contribute to the barrier crash costs is crucial for the future barriers’ optimization process. Thus, contributory factors to barriers crash cost with high, medium, and low values, corresponding to 95th, 70th, and 60th percentiles were considered, and a comparison was made across these models. It was found, for instance, that although factors such as rollover, driving under the influence, and presence of heavy truck all have contributory impacts on the cost of crashes, their impacts are greater on higher quantiles, or higher barriers’ costs. These models were compared from various perspectives such as intra class correlation (ICC), and standard error of coefficients. This study highlights the changes in coefficient estimates while modeling crash costs.}

We conducted human-in-the-loop experiments with 24 participants. In the experiment, a human operator and an autonomy module for navigation shared the control of a simulated notional High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) at a fixed speed. At the same time, the human operator performed a target detection task. The autonomy could be either adaptive or non-adaptive to the above-mentioned human factors. Results indicate that the adaptive haptic control scheme resulted in significantly lower workload, higher trust in autonomy, better driving task performance and smaller control effort.}

This has been achieved by conducting simulated (and occasionally, field) driving experiments while collecting driver brain signals of various types. Here, this sector of studies is comprehensively reviewed at both macro and micro scales. At the macro scale, bibliometric aspects of these studies are analysed. At the micro scale, different themes of neuroimaging driving behaviour research are identified and the findings within each theme are synthesised. The surveyed literature has reported on applications of four major brain imaging methods. These include Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), Electroencephalography (EEG), Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) and Magnetoencephalography (MEG), with the first two being the most common methods in this domain. While collecting driver fMRI signal has been particularly instrumental in studying neural correlates of intoxicated driving (e.g. alcohol or cannabis) or distracted driving, the EEG method has been predominantly utilised in relation to the efforts aiming at development of automatic fatigue/drowsiness detection systems, a topic to which the literature on neuro-ergonomics of driving particularly has shown a spike of interest within the last few years. The survey also reveals that topics such as driver brain activity in semi-automated settings or neural activity of drivers with brain injuries or chronic neurological conditions have by contrast been investigated to a very limited extent. Potential topics in driving behaviour research are identified that could benefit from the adoption of neuroimaging methods in future studies. In terms of practicality, while fMRI and MEG experiments have proven rather invasive and technologically challenging for adoption in driving behaviour research, EEG and fNIRS applications have been more diverse. They have even been tested beyond simulated driving settings, in field driving experiments. Advantages and limitations of each of these four neuroimaging methods in the context of driving behaviour experiments are outlined in the paper.}

The present study aims at utilizing crash narratives complemented by crash metadata to discern the prevalence and co-occurrence of themes that contribute to crash incidents. Ten years (2009–2018) of Michigan traffic fatal crash narratives were used as a case study. The structural topic modeling (STM) and network topology analysis were used to generate and examine the prevalence and interaction of themes from the crash narratives that were mainly categorized into pre-crash events, crash locations and involved parties in the traffic crashes. The main advantage of the STM over the other topic modeling approaches is that it allows the researchers to discover themes from documents and estimate how the topic relates to the document metadata. Topics with the highest prevalence for the angle, head-on, rear-end, sideswipe and single motor vehicle crashes were crash at stop-sign, crossing the centerline, unable to stop, lane change maneuver and run-off-road crash, respectively. Eigenvector centrality measure in network topology showed that event-related topics were consistently central in articulating the crash occurrence. The centrality and association between topics varied across crash types. The efficacy of generated topics in classifying crashes by type was tested using a machine learning algorithm, Random Forest. The classification accuracy in the held-out sample ranged between 89.3 % for sideswipe crashes to 99.2 % for single motor vehicle crashes. High classification accuracy suggests that automation of crash typing and consistency checks can be accomplished effectively by using extracted latent themes from the crash narratives.}

Consequently, DUI violators’ involvement in severe crashes is high. Motivated by the spatial and temporal nature of traffic crashes, this study introduces an integrated spatio-temporal approach to analyzing highway safety data. Specifically, this study estimates Geographically and Temporally Weighted Regression (GTWR) models to understand the consequences of DUI in crashes. GTWR can theoretically outperform traditional regression methods by accounting for unobserved heterogeneity that may be related to the location and time of a crash. Using Southeast Michigan crash data, this study finds that DUI is associated with a 25% higher likelihood of injury in a crash. The association between injury severity and DUI varies significantly across space and time. From the spatial aspect, DUI crashes in rural or small-town areas are more likely to cause injuries than urban crashes. From the temporal aspect, different times are associated with varying relationships between injury severity and DUI. If focusing on DUI crashes in late nights and early mornings, on Fridays, the entire northeast part from Clinton Charter Township to Port Huron is associated with severer injuries than other regions including Detroit’s urban area and its south. On Mondays, the DUI crashes in the northwest are also more likely to cause severe injuries. The methodology introduced in this study takes advantage of modern computational tools and localized crash/inventory data. This method offers researchers and practitioners an opportunity to understand highway safety outcomes in great spatial and temporal details and customize safety countermeasures for specific locations and times such as saturation patrols.}

abstract = {Traditional methods for identifying crash-prone roadways are mainly based on historical crash data. It usually requires more than three years to collect a sufficient amount of dataset for road safety assessment. However, the emerging connected vehicles (CVs) technology generates rich instantaneous information, which can be used to identify dangerous road sections proactively. Information about the identified crash-prone intersections can be shared with the surrounding vehicles via CVs communication technology to promote cautious driving behaviors; in the longer term, such information will guide the implementation of countermeasures to prevent potential crashes. This study proposed a deep-learning based method to predict the risk level at intersections based on CVs data from the Michigan Safety Pilot program and historical traffic and intersection crash data in areas around Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA. One month of data by CVs at intersections were used for analyses, which accounts for about 3%–12% of overall trips. The risk levels of 774 intersections (i.e., low, medium and high risk) are determined by the annual crash rates. Feature extraction process is applied to both CV’s data and traffic data at each intersection and 24 features are extracted. Two black-box deep-learning models, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN) are trained with the extracted features. A number of hyperparameters that affect prediction performance are fine-tuned using Bayesian optimization algorithm for each model. The performance of the two deep learning models, which are black-box models, were also compared with a decision tree model, a white-box type of simple machine learning model. The results showed that the accuracies of deep learning (DL) models were slightly better (both over 90 %) than the decision tree model (about 87 %). This indicated that the DL models were capable of uncover the inherent complexity from the dataset and therefore provided higher accuracy than the traditional machine learning model. CNN model achieves slightly higher accuracy (93.8 %) and is recommended as the classifier to predict the risk level at intersections in practice. The interpretability analysis of the CNN model is conducted to confirm the validity of the model. This study shows that combination of CVs data (V2V and V2I) and deep learning networks (i.e. MLP and CNN used in this paper) is promising to determine crash risks at intersections with high time efficiency and at low CV penetration rates, which help to deploy countermeasures to reduce the crash rates and resolve traffic safety problems.}

While various studies have attempted to examine the effectiveness of different driving aids discretely, it is still vague how drivers perform when they are exposed to a connected environment with vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication capabilities. As such, the objective of this study is to examine the effects of the connected environment on driving behavior and safety. To achieve this aim, an innovative driving simulator experiment was designed to mimic a connected environment using the CARRS-Q Advanced Driving Simulator. Two types of driving aids were disseminated in the connected environment: continuous and event-based information. Seventy-eight participants with diverse backgrounds drove the simulator in four driving conditions: baseline (without driving aids), perfect communication (uninterrupted supply of driving aids), communication delay (driving aids are delayed), and communication loss (intermittent loss of driving aids). Various key driving behavior indicators were analyzed and compared across various routine driving tasks such as car-following, lane-changing, interactions with traffic lights, and giving way to pedestrians at pedestrian crossings. Results suggest that drivers in the perfect communication scenario maintain a longer time-to-collision during car-following, a longer time-to-collision to pedestrian, a lower deceleration to avoid a crash during lane-changing, and a lower propensity of yellow light running. Overall, drivers in the connected environment are found to make informed (thus better) decisions towards safe driving.}

abstract = {Thorough evaluations on injury risk (IR) are fundamental for guiding interventions toward the enhancement of both the road infrastructure and the active/passive safety of vehicles. Well-established estimates are currently based on IR functions modeled on post-crash variables, such as velocity change sustained by the vehicle (ΔV); thence, these analyses do not directly suggest how pre-crash conditions can be modified to allow for IR reduction. Nevertheless, ΔV can be disaggregated into two contributions which enable its a priori calculation, based only on the information available at the impact instant: the Crash Momentum Index (CMI), representing impact eccentricity at collision, and the closing velocity at collision (Vr). By extensively employing the CMI indicator, this work assesses the overall influence of impact eccentricity and closing velocity on the risk for occupants to sustain a serious injury. As CMI synthesizes indications regarding ΔV, its use can be disjointed from the ΔV itself for the derivation of high-quality IR models. This feature distinguishes CMI from the other eccentricity indicators available at the state-of-the-art, allowing for the contribution of eccentricity on IR to be completely isolated. Because of this element of originality, special attention is given to the CMI variable throughout the present work. Based on data extracted from the NASS/CDS database, the influence of the CMI and Vr variables on IR is specifically highlighted and analyzed from several perspectives. The feature ranking algorithm ReliefF, whose use is unprecedented in the accident analysis field, is first employed to assess importance of such impact-related variables in determining the injury outcome: if compared to vehicle-related and occupant-related variables (as category and age, respectively), the higher influence of CMI and Vr is initially highlighted. Secondly, the relevance of CMI and Vr is confirmed by fitting different predictive models: the fitted models which include the CMI predictor perform better than models which neglect the CMI, in terms of classical evaluation metrics. As a whole, considering the high predictive power of the proposed CMI-based models, this work provides valuable tools for the a priori assessment of IR.}

abstract = {The consequences of crashes, including injury, loss of lives, and damage to properties, are further worsened when buses plying expressways are involved in the crash. Previous studies have separately analyzed crash severity in terms of monetary cost, injuries and loss of lives, and the size of crashes in terms of the number of vehicles involved. However, as both outcome variables are correlated, it is imperative to perform a combined analysis using an appropriate econometric model to achieve a better model fit. This study contributes to the literature by jointly exploring the factors influencing the severity and size of express bus-involved crashes that occur on expressways and characterizes the dependence between both outcome variables by employing a more plausible copula regression framework. Likelihood ratio tests were also conducted to investigate the temporal stability of the factors that affect both crash severity and size. Based on the goodness-of-fit statistics, the Frank copula model proved superior to the independent ordered probit model. The estimate of the underlying dependence between the outcome variables provided a better comprehension of the correlation between them. Temporal instability was detected for the individual parameters in the models and is attributed to the changing driving behavior due to the heightened road safety campaigns. The results suggest that traffic exposure measures are significantly associated with a higher propensity of observing increased bus crash severity and size. Insights into the factors influencing the size and severity of express bus crashes are discussed, and appropriate engineering, enforcement, and education-related countermeasures are proposed.}

Tremendous previous studies have conducted relevant analysis with econometric modeling approaches, whereas the ability of non-parametric methods to predict crash severity is still smattering of knowledge. Consequently, the main objective of this paper is to conduct single-vehicle crash severity prediction with different tree-based and non-parameter models. An alternate aim is to identify the intrinsic mechanism of how contributing factors determine single-vehicle crash severity. By virtue of Grid-Search method, this paper conducted fine-tuning of different models to obtain the best performances based on five crash severity sub-datasets. For model evaluation, the accuracy indicators were calculated in training, validation and test sets, respectively. Besides, feature importance extraction was undertaken based on the results of model comparison. The finding indicated that these models didn’t exhibit a huge performance difference for crash severity prediction in the same severity level; however, the performances of the models did vary among different datasets, with an average training accuracy of 99.27 %, 96.4 %, 86.98 %, 86.84 %, 71.76 % in fatal injury, severe injury, visible injury, complaint of pain, PDO crash datasets, respectively. Additionally, it was found that in each severity dataset, the indicator urban freeways is a determinant factor that leads to the occurrence of crashes while rural freeways is more related to more severe crashes (i.e., fatal and severe crashes). This paper can provide valuable information for model selection and tuning in accident severity prediction. Future research could consider the influences that temporal instability of contributing features has on the model performances.}

The crashes impose a tremendous social and economic cost to society and might affect the involving individuals’ quality of life. As it stands, road injuries are ranked among top-ten leading causes of death by the World Health Organization. Distracted driving is defined as an attention diversion of the driver toward a competing activity. It was shown in numerous studies that distracted driving increase the probability of near-crash or crash events. By leveraging the statistical power of the large SHRP2 naturalistic data, we are able to quantify the preponderance of specific distractions during daily trips and confirm the causality factor of an ubiquitous non-driving task in the crash event. We show that, except for phone usage which happens more frequently in near-crash and crash categories than in baseline trips, both distracted driving and secondary tasks occur almost uniformly in different types of trips. In this study, we investigate the impact of the co-occurrence of distracted driving with other driving behaviors and secondary tasks. It is found that the co-occurrence of distracted driving with other driving behaviors or secondary tasks increase the chance of near-crash and crash events. This study's findings can inform the design and development of more precise and reliable driving assistance and warning systems.}

This research investigates pedestrians’ gap acceptance and crossing speed for midblock crossings by image processing methods in Izmir, Turkey. A total of 498 pedestrians have been tracked at two midblock crossings. The data were collected for one hour at each midblock crossing during the evening peak hour between 5.00–6.00 p.m. Three synchronized cameras were used to record pedestrian crossings. Then, by using image processing, vehicle and pedestrian trajectories have been obtained. Two cameras were mounted on telescopic tripods reaching up to 9 m, and the third camera was used to identify pedestrians’ gender better. The parameters extracted from the recordings are; pedestrians’ gender, group size, whether they carried items or not, and their accepted/rejected gaps. Pedestrian and item detection has been performed by YOLOv3 and YOLACT models. The accepted and rejected time gaps were extracted for pedestrians, excluding the pedestrians who crossed between stopped vehicles and crossed when an approaching vehicle did not exist within 100 m from the midblock crossing. Raff’s method was used to estimate the critical gap using accepted/rejected gaps. The critical gaps ranged between 4.1 s and 6.2 s. The 15th percentile crossing speeds were found to be similar, ranging between 0.78 m/s and 0.80 m/s.}

The data used in this study refer to the 6167 crashes occurred in the section Naples–Candela of A16 motorway, Italy in the period from 2001 to 2011. The analysis was carried out using the rule discovery technique due to its ability of extracting knowledge from large amounts of data previously unknown and indistinguishable by investigating patterns that occur together in a given event. The rules were filtered by support, confidence, lift, and validated by the lift increase criterion. A two-step analysis was carried out. In the first step, rules discovering factors contributing to ROR crashes were identified. In the second step, studying only ROR crashes, rules discovering factors contributing to severe and fatal injury (KSI) crashes were identified. As a result, 94 significant rules for ROR crashes and 129 significant rules for KSI crashes were identified. These rules represent several combinations of geometric design, roadside, barrier performance, crash dynamic, vehicle, environmental and drivers’ characteristics associated with an overrepresentation of frequency and severity of ROR crashes. From the methodological point of view, study results show that the a priori algorithm was effective in providing new information which was previously hidden in the data. Finally, several countermeasures to solve or mitigate the safety issues identified in this study were discussed. It is worthwhile to observe that the study showed a combination of factors contributing to the overrepresentation of frequency and severity of ROR crashes. Consequently, the implementation of a combination of countermeasures is recommended.}

abstract = {Given the severe traffic safety issue, tremendous efforts have been devoted to identify the crash contributing factors for developing and implementing safety improvement countermeasures. According to the study findings, driving behaviors have attributed to the majority crash occurrence, among which inadequate driving capability is a key factor. Therefore, a number of studies have been conducted for developing techniques associated with the driving capability assessment and its various improvement. However, the conventional assessment approaches, such as driving license exams and vehicle insurance quotes, have only focused on basic driving skill evaluations or aggregated driving style classifications, which failed to quantify driving capability from the safety perspective with respect to the complex driving scenarios. In this study, a novel longitudinal driving capacity assessment and ranking approach was developed with naturalistic driving data. Two Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) based driving capability indicators from the perspectives of risk exposure and severity were first proposed. Then, Bayesian Tobit quantile regression (BTQR) models were introduced to explore the relationships between driving capability indicators with trip level characteristics from the aspects of travel features, operational conditions, and roadway characteristics. The modeling results concluded that nighttime driving and higher average speed would lead to higher longitudinal collision risk and its severity. Besides, the BTQR models have provided varying factors significances among different quantile levels, for instance, driving duration is only significant at high quantiles for the driving capability indicators, implying that duration only affects drivers with large longitudinal risk exposures and strong close following tendencies. Furthermore, the case studies provided how to deploy the developed model to obtain the relative longitudinal driving capability rankings. Finally, the model applications from the aspects of commercial fleet safety management and comparing the autonomous vehicles’ longitudinal driving behaviors with human drivers have been discussed.}

This study aimed to develop effective approaches for predicting at-fault crash driver frequency using only city-level traffic enforcement predictors. A fusion deep learning approach combining a convolution neural network (CNN) and gated recurrent units (GRU) was developed to compare predictive performance with one econometric approach, two machine learning approaches, and another deep learning approach. The performance comparison was conducted for (1) at-fault crash driver frequency prediction tasks and (2) city-level crash risk prediction tasks. The proposed CNN-GRU achieved remarkable prediction accuracy and outperformed other approaches, while the other approaches also exhibited excellent performances. The results suggest that effective prediction approaches and appropriate traffic safety measures can be developed by considering both crash frequency and crash risk prediction tasks. In addition, the accumulated local effects (ALE) plot was utilized to investigate the contribution of each traffic enforcement activity on traffic safety in a scenario of multicollinearity among predictors. The ALE plot illustrated a complex nonlinear relationship between traffic enforcement predictors and the response variable. These findings can facilitate the development of traffic safety measures and serve as a good foundation for further investigations and utilization of traffic violation data.}

As both estimation and prediction would greatly improve if the missing values were recovered, this study proposes a sequential approach to handle incomplete crash datasets and rank contributors to the injury severity of crashes on mountainous freeways in China. The sequential approach consists of two parts: (i) multivariate imputation by chained equations imputes the missing values of independent variables; (ii) a random forest classifier analyses the correlation between the dependent and the independent variables. The first part considers different imputation methods in light of the independent variables being either binary, categorical or continuous, whereas the second part classifies the correlations according to the random forest classifier. The proposed method was applied to the case-study about mountainous freeways in China and compared to the analysis of the raw dataset to evaluate its effectiveness, and the results illustrate that the method improves significantly the classification accuracy when compared with existing methods. Moreover, the classifier ranked the contributors to the injury severity of traffic crashes on mountainous freeways: in order of importance vehicle type, crash type, road longitudinal gradient, crash cause, curve radius, and deflection angles. Interestingly, a lower importance was found for environmental factors.}

Taking this observation as a starting point, this study examines the relationship between highway safety and socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, using an extensive crash dataset from Kentucky. Its focus is single- and two-unit crashes that involve commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) and automobiles. Using binary logistic regression and the quasi-induced exposure technique to analyze data on the socioeconomic and demographic attributes of the zip codes in which drivers reside, factors are identified which can serve as indicators of crash occurrence. Variables such as income, education level, poverty level, employment, age, gender, and rurality of the driver’s zip code influence the likelihood of a driver being at fault in a crash. Socioeconomic factors exert a similar influence on CMV and automobile crashes, irrespective of the number of vehicles involved. Research findings can be used to identify groups of drivers most likely to be involved in crashes and develop targeted and efficient safety programs.}

In this regard, this research employed an integrated microsimulation modeling approach to assess the safety performance of the WYDOT CV Pilot. A 23-mile representative I-80 corridor was selected for developing the microsimulation models. Traffic flow and driving behavior data under winter snowy weather condition were collected to calibrate the baseline microsimulation model. A driving simulator experiment was conducted to quantitatively investigate the impacts of CV technology on driving behavior; accordingly, the driving behavior data under CV environment were employed to properly update the calibrated CV microsimulation models. The safety effectiveness of the WYDOT CV Pilot were assessed for various demand levels and CV penetration rates. It was concluded that WYDOT CV applications increased drivers’ situation awareness under adverse weather conditions, and thus reduced the crash risk. The reductions in conflicts displayed a decreasing trend with the increase of CV penetration rates, but the reduction was not significant when CV penetration was lower than 10 percent. The maximum reduction in conflicts was 85 percent when all trucks were equipped with CV technology.}

Take-over performance and driving performance were assessed a) under alert baseline conditions and b) after awakening from electroencephalography-confirmed stable sleep. Take-over performance 15 s after awakening was impaired resulting in more driving errors compared to the alert baseline. Lane keeping was dramatically impaired in the first 3 min after sleep and recovered rapidly. Drivers drove slower after sleep and speed keeping was less stable for at least 10 min.

Therefore, it is essential to identify the leading causes of crashes involving HAZMAT vehicles and make specific countermeasures to improve the safety of expressways. This study aims to employ the association rules mining (ARM) approach to discover the contributory crash-risk factors of HAZMAT vehicle-involved crashes on expressways. A case study is conducted using crash data obtained from the Korea Expressway Corporation crash database from 2008 to 2017. ARM was conducted using the Apriori algorithm, and a total of 855 interesting rules were generated. With appropriate support, confidence, and lift values, we found hidden patterns in the HAZMAT crash characteristics. The results indicate that HAZMAT vehicle-involved crashes are highly associated with male drivers, single vehicle-involved crashes, clear weather conditions, daytime, and mainline segments. Also, we found that HAZMAT tank-lorry and cargo truck crashes, single vehicle-involved crashes, and crashes on mainline segments of expressways had independent and unique association rules. The finding from this study demonstrates that ARM is a plausible data mining technique that can be employed to draw relationships between HAZMAT vehicle-involved crashes and significant crash-risk factors, and has the potential of providing more easy-to-understand results and relevant insights for the safety improvement of expressways.}

In this study, we attempted to explain drivers’ takeover performance variation in a level 3 automated vehicle in consideration of the effects of trust, system characteristics, environmental characteristics, and driver characteristics with a structural equation model. The model was built by incorporating drivers’ takeover time and quality as endogenous variables. A theoretical framework of the model was hypothesized on the basis of the ACT-R cognitive architecture and relevant research results. The validity of the model was confirmed using data collected from 136 driving simulator samples under the condition of voluntary non-driving-related tasks. Results revealed that takeover time budget was the most critical factor in promoting the safety and stability of takeover process, which, together with traffic density, drivers’ age and manual driving experience, determined drivers’ takeover quality directly. In addition, the pre-existing experience with an automated system or a similar technology and self-confidence of the driver, as well as takeover time budget, strongly influenced the takeover time directly. Apart from the direct effects mentioned above, trust, as an intermediary variable, explained a major portion of the variance in takeover time. Theoretically, these findings suggest that takeover behavior could be comprehensively evaluated from the two dimensions of takeover time and quality through the combination of trust, driver characteristics, environmental characteristics, and vehicle characteristics. The influence mechanism of the above factors is complex and multidimensional. In addition to the form of direct influence, trust, as an intermediary variable, could reflect the internal mechanism of the takeover behavior variation. Practically, the findings emphasize the crucial role of trust in the change in takeover behavior through the dimensions of subjective trust level and monitoring strategy, which may provide new insights into the function design of takeover process.}

abstract = {Traffic conflicts are heavily correlated with traffic collisions and may provide insightful information on the failure mechanism and factors that contribute more towards a collision. Although proactive traffic management systems have been supported heavily in the research community, and autonomous vehicles (AVs) are soon to become a reality, analyses are concentrated on very specific environments using aggregated data. This study aims at investigating –for the first time- rear-end conflict frequency in an urban network level using vehicle-to-vehicle interactions and at correlating frequency with the corresponding network traffic state. The Time-To-Collision (TTC) and Deceleration Rate to Avoid Crash (DRAC) metrics are utilized to estimate conflict frequency on the current network situation, as well as on scenarios including AV characteristics. Three critical conflict points are defined, according to TTC and DRAC thresholds. After extracting conflicts, data are fitted into Zero-inflated and also traditional Negative Binomial models, as well as quasi-Poisson models, while controlling for endogeneity, in order to investigate contributory factors of conflict frequency. Results demonstrate that conflict counts are significantly higher in congested traffic and that high variations in speed increase conflicts. Nevertheless, a comparison with simulated AV traffic and the use of more surrogate safety indicators could provide more insight into the relationship between traffic state and traffic conflicts in the near future.}

abstract = {While computer vision techniques and big data of street-level imagery are getting increasing attention, a “black-box” model of deep learning hinders the active application of these techniques to the field of traffic safety research. To address this issue, we presented a semantic scene labeling approach that leverages wide-coverage street-level imagery for the purpose of exploring the association between built environment characteristics and perceived crash risk at 533 intersections. The environmental attributes were measured at eye-level using scene segmentation and object detection algorithms, and they were classified as one of four intersection typologies using the k-means clustering method. Data on perceived crash risk were collected from a questionnaire conducted on 799 children 10 to 12 years old. Our results showed that environmental features derived from deep learning algorithms were significantly associated with perceived crash risk among school-aged children. The results have revealed that some of the intersection characteristics including the proportional area of sky and roadway were significantly associated with the perceived crash risk among school-aged children. In particular, road width had dominant influence on risk perception. The findings provide information useful to providing appropriate and proactive interventions that may reduce the risk of crashes at intersections.}

To improve the traffic safety pro-actively, this study proposes a safety-oriented ATSC algorithm to optimize traffic efficiency and safety simultaneously. A multi-objective deep reinforcement learning framework is utilized as the backend algorithm. The proposed algorithm was trained and evaluated on a simulated isolated intersection built based on real-world traffic data. A real-time crash prediction model was calibrated to provide the safety measure. The performance of the algorithm was evaluated by the real-world signal timing provided by the local jurisdiction. The results showed that the algorithm improves both traffic efficiency and safety compared with the benchmark. A control policy analysis of the proposed ATSC revealed that the abstracted control rules could help the traditional signal controllers to improve traffic safety, which might be beneficial if the infrastructure is not ready to adopt ATSCs. A hybrid controller is also proposed to provide further traffic safety improvement if necessary. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the proposed algorithm is the first successful attempt in developing adaptive traffic signal system optimizing traffic safety.}

A new method of safety analysis based on failure-caused traffic conflicts and the Lomax distribution was recently proposed to estimate crash frequency more efficiently than with crash data. This paper has two objectives: (1) demonstrate the method applicability to near-departure data collected in a driving simulator, and (2) provide initial evidence of the method validity. Traffic failures and road users’ delayed responses to these failures is considered as the primary cause of both conflicts and crashes. Unlike early postulated exceedance distributions the proposed Lomax distribution of response delays was derived from the causal mechanism. From this perspective, the proposed method may use the entire range of the underlying distribution as long as the observed conflicts are failure-related. The fundamentals of the method are briefly explained with the emphasis on certain behavior of crash frequency estimates implied by the proposed theory. Then, an example application of the method to analyze the risk of road departures in a driving simulator is presented. The results are then inspected and the trend in the estimates derived from the theory is confirmed. This finding points to the method validity. Additional applications of the method are expected to further increase the confidence towards the method and to encourage its introduction to the safety engineering practice.}

Consequently, ubiquitous internal and external communication (controls, commands, and data) within all CAV-related nodes is inevitably the gatekeeper for the smooth operation. Therefore, it is a primary vulnerable area for cyber-attacks that entails stringent and efficient measures in the form of "cybersecurity". There is a lack of systematic and comprehensive review of the literature on cyber-attacks on the CAVs, respective mitigation strategies, anticipated readiness, and research directions for the future. This study aims to analyse, synthesise, and interpret critical areas for the roll-out and progression of CAVs in combating cyber-attacks. Specifically, we described in a structured way a holistic view of potentially critical avenues, which lies at the heart of CAV cybersecurity research. We synthesise their scope with a particular focus on ensuring effective CAVs deployment and reducing the probability of cyber-attack failures. We present the CAVs communication framework in an integrated form, i.e., from In-Vehicle (IV) communication to Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2X) communication with a visual flowchart to provide a transparent picture of all the interfaces for potential cyber-attacks. The vulnerability of CAVs by proximity (or physical) access to cyber-attacks is outlined with future recommendations. There is a detailed description of why the orthodox cybersecurity approaches in Cyber-Physical System (CPS) are not adequate to counter cyber-attacks on the CAVs. Further, we synthesised a table with consolidated details of the cyber-attacks on the CAVs, the respective CAV communication system, its impact, and the corresponding mitigation strategies. It is believed that the literature discussed, and the findings reached in this paper are of great value to CAV researchers, technology developers, and decision-makers in shaping and developing a robust CAV-cybersecurity framework.}

The application of an eco-safe driving system is feasible with the support of vehicle-to-vehicle/infrastructure technologies. To guarantee system usability and safety appropriateness, a key precondition is to ensure that driver mental workload and visual demands required for using the system are reasonable. This study explored how drivers’ mental workload and visual demands were affected when driving with an eco-safe driving HMI (human-machine-interface). Four in-vehicle eco-safe HMI information conditions were evaluated, including baseline, advice only, feedback only, and advice & feedback. Two traffic scenarios (stop-sign intersection with traffic vs. stop-sign intersection without traffic) were simulated using an advanced driving simulator. Behavioural variables (e.g. brake force, acceleration), visual variables (e.g. blink metrics, pupil size) and subjective workload scores were collected from 36 licensed Australian drivers. The experiment results showed that the HMI prompted drivers to apply a smooth and stable brake force when they approached the intersection and a smooth acceleration when they left the intersection. Drivers’ mental workload indicated by visual measurements were consistent with their subjective reported workload levels. Drivers had a higher mental workload when they received and processed additional eco-safe information in the advice & feedback condition. An increase in mental workload induced by the in-vehicle cognitive task initiated more blink activities while the increase in visual demand caused by a complex road situation led to blink inhibition. The study shows the HMI could significantly promote eco-safe driving behaivours without causing excessive mental and visual workload of drivers.}

For instance, the dataset used in this paper consists of only 625 crash events for over 6.5 million non-crash events. Thus, learning algorithms tend to perform poorly on these datasets. We have used variational autoencoder to encode all the events into a latent space. After training, the model could successfully separate crash and non-crash events. To generate data, we sampled from the latent space containing crash data. The generated data was compared with the real data from different statistical aspects. t-Test, Levene-test and Kolmogrove Smirnov test showed that the generated data was statistically similar to the real data. It was also compared to some of the minority oversampling techniques like SMOTE and ADASYN as well as the GAN framework for generating data. Crash prediction models based on Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) were used to compare the generated data from the different oversampling techniques. Overall, variational autoencoder (VAE) showed excellent results compared to the other data augmentation methods. Specificity is improved by 8% and 4% for VAE-LR and VAE-SVM respectively when compared to SMOTE while the sensitivity is improved by 6% and 5% when compared to ADASYN. Moreover, VAE generated data also helps to overcome the overfitting problem in SMOTE and ADASYN since there is flexibility in choosing the decision boundary.}

abstract = {The frequent crash occurrences have caused massive loss of lives and properties all over the world. In order to improve traffic safety, it is vital to understand the relationships between traffic operation conditions and crash risk, and further implement safety countermeasures. Emerging studies have conducted the crash risk analyses using discrete and aggregated traffic data (e.g., loop detector data, probe vehicle data), where crash events were selected as the prediction target. However, traditional traffic sensing data obtained at segment level cannot describe the detailed operation conditions for the vehicle platoons near crash locations. Thus, more microscopic and high-resolution traffic sensing data are needed. In addition, considering the random occurrence feature of crashes, high-risk events should be paid more attentions given their higher occurrence probability and consistent causations with crashes, which could proactively reduce crash likelihood. In this study, HighD Dataset from German highways was utilized for the empirical analyses. First, high-risk events were obtained using safety surrogate measures with Modified Time to Collision (MTTC) less than 2 s. Traffic operation characteristics within 5 s prior to event occurrence were extracted based on vehicle trajectory data. Then, a total of three different logistic regression models were established, which are standard logistic regression model, random-effects logistic regression (RELR) model, and random-parameter logistic regression (RPLR) model. Among which, the RPLR model was showed to have the best fitness and prediction accuracy. The results showed that the disturbed traffic flows in both longitudinal and lateral directions have positive impacts on high-risk events occurrence. Besides, too close following distance between vehicles would lead to high-risk events. Moreover, RPLR models could provide a high prediction accuracy of 97 % for 2 s ahead of the high-risk events. Finally, potential safety improvement countermeasures and future application scenarios were also discussed.}

We do not find empirical evidence that videos with technical content (European school) change overconfidence. Since several works point to a strong association between overconfidence and road safety, our study can support the conduit of driving safety measures by identifying efficient ways of reducing drivers’ overconfidence. Finally, this paper also introduces how to use machine learning techniques to mitigate the usual subjectivity in the design of the econometric specification that is commonly faced in many researches in experimental economics.}

This calibrated variable, which is fitted with regression-based and machine learning models, is compared with the widely-used Delta-V predictor. A multivariate ordered logistic regression with multiple classes is then estimated. The results align with the observation that heavy vehicles are more likely to have inherent protection and rigid structures, especially in the side direction, and so suffer less impact.}

This investigation has shown that accidents due to the traffic represent around 50 % of the total number of accidents every year. Among them, rear-end collisions hold a 20 % share. These numbers display the fact that the interaction between drivers can be held responsible of those incidents. In this respect, we have explored the reasons behind the conflict situations that may be responsible of the occurrence of rear-end collisions by the mean of a cognitive psychology based cellular automata model. Indeed, through field experiments performed by an embedded camera, we have extricated a psychological cognitive process of anticipation. We have defined the latter as the tendency of drivers to accelerate based on the history of their predecessor. Then, we have exploited the tools of the physics of traffic by which we have developed a CA-model that take into consideration this process. As a result, we were able to generate those incidents’ situations. By considering two types of drivers: conservative who respect the learned information about the safe manoeuvres but make mistakes or aggressive who violate those secure processes, we have proved the complexity of the relationship between the states of the traffic flow and the drivers’ behaviours. In fact, we have shown that rear-end collisions are a result of the anticipation as a response of the drivers to the traffic conditions: the congestion. Moreover, we have also highlighted an improvement of the flow in the congested state up to 11 % due to the anticipation, but that can only be achieved through vehicle-to-vehicle communication. Finally, we have investigated the hot spots. We have found that the traffic perturbations, that generate those hot spots and can be responsible of collisions, are more likely to be located away in the downstream direction. The distance between the two locations depends on the traffic density. This difference between the positions of the traffic perturbation and the hot spot has showcased the complexity, in time and space, of the transmission and the reception of deceleration information by the drivers.}

Fixed infrastructure-based vehicle detection devices were widely used in the previous studies to obtain different types of data for crash potential prediction. However, it was difficult to obtain data in large range through these devices due to the costs of installation and maintenance. This paper introduced a novel connected vehicle (CV) emulated data for real-time crash potential prediction. Different from the fixed devices’ data, CV emulated data have high flexibility and can be obtained continuously with relatively low cost. Crash and CV emulated data were collected from two urban arterials in Orlando, USA. Crash data were archived by the Signal for Analytics system (S4A), while the CV emulated data were obtained through the data collection API with a high frequency. Different data cleaning and preparation techniques were implemented, while various speed-related variables were generated from the CV emulated data. A Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) neural network was trained to predict the crash potential in the next 5−10 min. The results from the model illustrated the feasibility of using a novel CV emulated data to predict real-time crash potential. The average and 50th percentile speed were the two most important variables for the crash potential prediction. In addition, the proposed LSTM outperformed Bayesian logistics regression and XGBoost in terms of sensitivity, Area under Curve (AUC), and false alarm rate. With the rapid development of the connected vehicle systems, the results from this paper can be extended to other types of vehicles and data, which can significantly enhance traffic safety.}

These systems pre-dominantly employ two components-sensors placed near the work zone perimeter that detect intrusions, and alarms placed closed to or carried by the workers that alerts them. This study investigates the association between layout of these components for three WZIAS on work zone crashes based on worker reaction. Also, the key determinants of work zone crashes in presence of the WZIAS is identified using survival analysis. The ideal deployment strategy and use case scenarios for the three WZIAS is presented based on the findings of the study. The systems were subjected to rigorous testing that emulated intrusions to record worker reaction and determine occurrence of crashes. Analysis of results indicate that the key determinants of work zone crashes are speed of the intruding vehicle, distance between the sensor and worker, and accuracy of a system in detecting intrusions and alerting workers. Results from field experiments suggest that identification of appropriate use cases for WZIAS is necessary to ensure they work effectively. Based on the findings from this study it is suggested that current guidelines on work zones be modified to standardize WZIAS setup.}

To solve the scarcity of incident samples, a novel incident detection framework is proposed based on generative adversarial networks (GANs). First, spatial and temporal rules are presented to extract variables from traffic data, which is followed by the random forest algorithm to rank the importance of variables. Then, some new incident samples are generated using GANs. Finally, the support vector machine algorithm is applied as the incident detection model. Real traffic data, which were collected from a 69.5-mile section of the I-80 highway, are used to validate the proposed approach. A total of 140 detectors are installed on the section enabling traffic flow to be measured every 30s. During 14 days, 139 incident samples and 946 nonincident samples were extracted from the raw data. Five categories of experiments are designed to evaluate whether the proposed framework can solve the small sample size problem, imbalanced sample problem, and timeliness problem in the current incident detection system. The experimental results show that our proposed framework can considerably improve the detection rate and reduce the false alarm rate of traffic incident detection. The balance of the dataset can improve the detection rate from 87.48% to 90.68% and reduce the false alarm rate from 12.76% to 7.11%. This paper lends support to further studies on combining GANs with the machine learning model to address the imbalance and small sample size problems related to intelligent transportation systems.}

abstract = {Safety assessment of road sections and networks have historically relied on police-reported crash data. These data have several noteworthy and significant shortcomings, including under-reporting, subjectivism, post hoc assessment of crash causes and contributing factors, limited behavioural information, and omitted potential important crash-related factors resulting in an omitted variable bias. Moreover, crashes are relatively rare events and require long observation periods to justify expenditures. The rarity of crashes leads to a moral dilemma—we must wait for sufficient crashes to accrue at a site—some involving injuries and even death—to then justify improvements to prevent crashes. The more quickly the profession can end its reliance on crashes to assess road safety, the better. Surrogate safety assessment methodologies, in contrast, are proactive in design, do not rely on crashes, and require shorter observation timeframes in which to formulate reliable safety assessments. Although surrogate safety assessment methodologies have been developed and assessed over the past 50 years, an overarching and unifying framework does not exist to date. A unifying framework will help to contextualize the role of various methodological developments and begin a productive discussion in the literature about how the various pieces do or should fit together to understand road user risk better. This paper aims to fill this gap by thoroughly mapping traffic conflicts and surrogate safety methodologies. A total of 549 studies were meticulously reviewed to achieve this aim of developing a unifying framework. The resulting framework provides a consolidated and up-to-date summary of surrogate safety assessment methodologies and conflict measures and metrics. Further work is needed to advance surrogate safety methodologies. Critical research needs to include identifying a comprehensive and reliable set of surrogate measures for risk assessment, establishing rigorous relationships between conflicts and crashes, developing ways to capture road user behaviours into surrogate-based safety assessment, and integrating crash severity measures into risk estimation.}

abstract = {With the development and maturation of vehicle-based data acquisition technology, in-vehicle data is increasingly being used to explore road safety. This paper reports on research that analyzed the real-time tire force data (kinetic response) obtained from vehicle kinetic experiments, and constructed a new approach for identifying the high-risk of crashes on freeway segments with horizontal curvature. First, the road was divided into 1km units. Then, taking into account the characteristics of freeway alignment, each segment with horizontal curve was selected as the object of subsequent analysis. Automotive instrumentation was used to obtain a measure of tire force in the course of normal driving. The entire data set was preprocessed according to rate of change and the density of the data was reduced. By defining the outliers of the kinetic data and conducting factor analysis, two representative crash risk indicators of longitudinal and lateral stability were obtained. Negative binomial regression model (NBR model) and random effects negative binomial regression model (RENBR model) were constructed and jointly applied based on the new indicators to predict the risk value of horizontal curve segments. The method showed good prediction performance (71.8 %) for high-risk road segments with design flaws, but the predicted effect for low-risk road segments was not ideal. This study not only illustrated the effectiveness of in-vehicle data in assessing road crash risk by coupling multiple kinetic parameters, but also provided support for freeway safety research using surrogate measures of risk when there is a lack of crash statistics.}

abstract = {Driver sleepiness is a major contributor to road crashes. A system that monitors and warns the driver at a certain, critical level of arousal, could aid in reducing sleep-related crashes. To determine how driver sleepiness detection systems perform, a systematic review of the sensitivity and specificity outcomes was performed. In total, 21 studies were located that met inclusion criteria for the review. The range of sensitivity outcomes was between 39.0–98.8 % and between 73.0–98.9 % for specificity outcomes. There was considerable variation in the outcomes of the studies employing only one physiological measure (mono-signal approach), whereas, a poly-signal approach with multiple physiological signals resulted in more consistency with higher outcomes on both sensitivity and specificity metrics. Only six of the 21 studies had both sensitivity and specificity outcomes above 90.0 %, which included mono- and poly-signal approaches. Moreover, increases in the number of features used in the sleepiness detection system did not result in higher sensitivity and specificity outcomes. Overall, there was considerable variability between the studies reviewed, including measures of ground truth, the features employed and the machine learning approach of the systems. A critical need for progressing any system is a revalidation of the system on a new sample of users. These aspects indicate considerable progress is needed with physiological-based driver sleepiness systems before they are at a sufficient standard to be deployed on-road.}

abstract = {The availability of large-scale naturalistic driving data provides enormous opportunities for studying relationships between instantaneous driving decisions prior to involvement in safety critical events (SCEs). This study investigates the role of driving instability prior to involvement in SCEs. While past research has studied crash types and their contributing factors, the role of pre-crash behavior in such events has not been explored as extensively. The research demonstrates how measures and analysis of driving volatility can be leading indicators of crashes and contribute to enhancing safety. Highly detailed microscopic data from naturalistic driving are used to provide the analytic framework to rigorously analyze the behavioral dimensions and driving instability that can lead to different types of SCEs such as roadway departures, rear end collisions, and sideswipes. Modeling results reveal a positive association between volatility and involvement in SCEs. Specifically, increases in both lateral and longitudinal volatilities represented by Bollinger bands and vehicular jerk lead to higher likelihoods of involvement in SCEs. Further, driver behavior related factors such as aggressive driving and lane changing also increases the likelihood of involvement in SCEs. Driver distraction, as represented by the duration of secondary tasks, also increases the risk of SCEs. Likewise, traffic flow parameters play a critical role in safety risk. The risk of involvement in SCEs decreases under free flow traffic conditions and increases under unstable traffic flow. Further, the model shows prediction accuracy of 88.1 % and 85.7 % for training and validation data. These results have implications for proactive safety and providing in-vehicle warnings and alerts to prevent the occurrence of such SCEs.}

It was shown that the annual number of AA&P’s publications has grown exponentially and that over the course of its development, AA&P has been a leader in the field of road safety, both in terms of innovation and dissemination. By determining its key source countries and organizations, core authors, highly co-cited published documents, and high burst-strength publications, we showed that AA&P’s areas of focus include the “effects of hazard and risk perception on driving behavior”, “crash frequency modeling analysis”, “intentional driving violations and aberrant driving behavior”, “epidemiology, assessment and prevention of road traffic injuries”, and “crash-injury severity modeling analysis”. Furthermore, the key burst papers that have played an important role in advancing research and guiding AA&P in new directions – particularly those in the fields of crash frequency and crash-injury severity modeling analyses were identified. Finally, a modified Haddon matrix in the era of intelligent, connected and autonomous transportation systems is proposed to provide new insights into the emerging generation of road safety studies.}

abstract = {The era of ‘Big Data’ provides opportunities for researchers to have deep insights into traffic safety. By taking advantages of ‘Big Data’, this study proposes a data-driven method to develop a Copula-Bayesian Network (Copula-BN) using a large-scale naturalistic driving dataset with multiple features. The Copula-BN is able to explain the causality of a risky driving maneuver. As compared with conventional BNs, the Copula-BN developed in this study has the following advantages: the Copula-BN 1. Has a more rational and explainable structure; 2. Is less likely to be over-fitting and can attain more satisfactory prediction performance; and 3. Can handle not only discrete but also continuous features. In terms of technical innovations, Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) is used for feature selection, while Gaussian Copula function is employed to build the dependency structure of the Copula-BN. As for applications, the Copula-BNs are used to investigate the causality of risky lane-changing (LC) and car-following (CF) maneuvers, upon which the comparisons are made between the two essential but risky driving maneuvers. In this study, the Copula-BNs are developed based on the Second Highway Research Program (SHRP2) Naturalistic Driving Study (NDS) database. Upon network evaluation, the Copula-BNs for both risky LC and CF maneuvers demonstrate satisfactory structure performance and promising prediction performance. Feature inferences are conducted based on the Copula-BNs to respectively illustrate the causation of the two risky maneuvers. Several interesting findings related to features’ contribution are discussed in this paper. To a certain extent, the Copula-BN developed using the data-driven method makes a trade-off between prediction and causality within the ‘Big Data’. The comparison between risky LC and CF maneuvers also provides a valuable reference for crash risk evaluation, road safety policy-making, etc. In the future, the achievements of this study could be applied in Advanced Driver-Assistance System (ADAS) and accident diagnosis system to enhance road traffic safety.}

An LSTM (Long Short-term Memory) neural network is proposed to predict the pedestrian-vehicle conflicts 2 s ahead. The established model reaches an accuracy of 88.5 % at one signalized intersection. It is further tested at a new intersection, reaching the accuracy of 84.9 %, while the new data merely takes up 30 % of the training data set. This indicates that the proposed model is promising to be implemented at different locations. Moreover, the proposed model can also be applied to develop collision warning systems under the Connected Vehicles’ environment.}

The two main advantages of the proposed AID system are: (i) the use of Bluetooth sensors offers several practical advantages over inductive loop detectors (ILD), which is one of the preferred sensing technology for traffic flow; and (ii) the unsupervised anomaly detection approach builds a model without the need of incident information. A common problem when designing an AID system is that incident information, i.e., ground-truth data, with enough accuracy is seldom available. Isolation forest is the unsupervised anomaly detection approach adopted in this work. This method is based on characterizing anomalous traffic conditions by exploiting the fact that anomalies tend to be isolated. The most remarkable feature of this anomaly detection method is its high detection performance while having a very simple tuning procedure and an extremely low computational demand. Finally, the effectiveness of the presented AID method is demonstrated using real traffic data collected by a network of Bluetooth sensors installed in Ayalon Highway, Tel Aviv.}

New driver states will emerge with increasing automation level with drivers potentially being allowed to sleep while driving a highly automated vehicle. Still at some point during a drive, drivers will be required to or voluntarily take back control of the vehicle. A simulator study was conducted to investigate drivers’ ability to take over the vehicle control after sleeping. In a within-subjects study design N = 25 test drivers completed a drive using a highly automated driving system a) during day time after a full night of sleep and b) early in the morning after a night of partial sleep deprivation. During the second drive, sleep was measured in drivers according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) standard using electroencephalography (EEG). In total, the participants had to handle four takeover requests (TORs) from the system, two while being awake (day drive) and two when being awakened from sleep stage N2 (morning drive). The objective criticality of the situations was assessed performing the Takeover Controllability rating (TOC-rating). The results indicate that the applied takeover time of 60 s was sufficient for drivers to reengage in driving after sleeping. Reaction times were extended by about 3 s after sleep compared to the wake condition. Takeover performance assessed with the TOC-rating however was clearly worse after sleep than after wakefulness which was also reflected in the drivers’ subjective perception of the criticality of the situation. Further research is needed on how to deal with performance impairments after waking up from sleep during automated driving.}

This research investigated the use of SHRP2 Naturalistic Driving Study (NDS) data to assess infrastructure and other factors contributing to left turn crashes at signalized intersections, and how to improve older driver safety during such turns. NDS data for trips involving signalized intersections and crash or near-crash events were obtained for two driver age groups: drivers age 65 and over (older drivers) and a sample of drivers age 30−49, along with NDS pre-screening and questionnaire data. Video scoring of all trips was performed to collect additional information on intersection and trip conditions. To identify the most influential factors of crash risk during left turns at signalized intersections, machine learning and regression models were used. The results found that in the obtained NDS dataset, there was a relatively small volume of crashes during left turns at signalized intersections. Further, model results found the statistically significant variables of crash risk for older drivers were associated more with health and cognitive factors rather than the infrastructure or design of the intersections. The results suggest that a study using only SHRP2 NDS data will not lead to definitive findings or recommendations for infrastructure changes to increase safety for older drivers at signalized intersections and during left turns. Moreover, the findings of this study indicates the need to consider other data sources and data collection methods to address this critical literature gap in older driver safety.}

Events of harsh driver behavior (8592 harsh accelerations and 3946 harsh brakings) were mapped to delimited segments and junctions of two urban expressways in Athens, Greece. For the analysis, two multiple linear regression models and two log-linear regression models were developed. Results indicate that in road segments there is an increase in the number of harsh events if average traffic flow per lane increases in the respective areas. Furthermore, as the average occupancy increases in junctions, there is an increase in harsh accelerations, and as the average speed increases, more harsh deceleration events occur. It is evident that traffic characteristics (traffic flow & speed) have the most statistically significant impact on the frequency of harsh events compared to factors related to road geometry and driver behavior.}

abstract = {With the development of technology in the world, vehicles that reach high speeds are produced. In addition, with the increase of road width and quality, faster and more comfortable transportation can be provided. These developments also increase the speed violation rates of road vehicles. Drivers who violate speed limits can endanger both their own lives and the lives of others. Speed violations, of especially heavy vehicles, involve much greater risks than that of light vehicles. Heavy vehicles can cause more serious losses of lives and property in accidents, compared to the ones caused by light vehicles, as they can carry much more freight or passengers than light vehicles. In this study, data regarding the speed violations committed by heavy vehicles in Turkey, were used. Speed violations were divided into 10 classes according to the intensity of speed violation rates. After this process, all provinces were classified according to support vector machines (SVM), naive bayes (NB) and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithms. When the accuracy values and error scales of all three algorithms are examined, it has been determined that the algorithm that gives the most accurate results is the NB algorithm. Based on the classification of this algorithm, speed violation density maps of types of heavy vehicles in Turkey were created by using spatial analysis. According to the density maps, the provinces with the highest speed violations were identified. In the results, it was determined that the rate of heavy vehicle speed violation was highest in the cities such as Erzurum, Konya, and Muğla. Later, these cities were examined in terms of heavy vehicle mobility. At the end of this study, measures were proposed to reduce these violations in cities where speeding violations are intense. Material and moral damages can be prevented, to a great extent, with the implementation of recommendations of policymakers which can reduce speed violations.}

To this end, we comparatively apply three data balance methods, i.e., the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), the Borderline SMOTE (BL-SMOTE), and the Majority Weighted Minority Oversampling (MWMOTE). Then, we examine different Bayesian networks (BNs) to explore the contributing factors of fatal injury crashes. The 2016 highway crash data of Ghana are retrieved for the case study. The results show that the accuracy of the injury severity classification is improved by using the preprocessed data. Highest improvement is observed on the data preprocessed by the MWMOTE technique. Statistical verification is done by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The inference results of the best BNs show the significant factors of fatal crashes which include off-peak time, non-intersection area, pedestrian involved collisions, rural road environment, good tarred road, roads without shoulders, and multiple vehicles involved crash.}

Trends reveal that derailments consistently account for more than 70 % of the U.S. railroad industry’s average annual accident cost. Hence, knowledge of explanatory factors that distinguish derailments from other accident types can inform more cost-effective and impactful railroad risk management strategies. Five feature scoring methods, including ANOVA and Gini, agreed that the top four explanatory factors in accident type prediction were track class, type of movement authority, excess speed, and territory signalization. Among 11 different types of machine learning algorithms, the extreme gradient boosting method was most effective at predicting the accident type with an area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) metric of 89 %. Principle component analysis revealed that relative to other accident types, derailments were more strongly associated with lower track classes, non-signalized territories, and movement authorizations within restricted limits. On average, derailments occurred at 16 kph below the speed limit for the track class whereas other accident types occurred at 32 kph below the speed limit. Railroads can use the integrated data preparation, machine learning, and feature ranking framework presented to gain additional insights for managing risk, based on their unique operating environments.}

abstract = {The Active Traffic Management (ATM) system has been widely used in the United States and the European countries to improve the traffic safety of urban expressways. The accurate real-time crash risk prediction is fundamental to the system running well. Crash data are characterized by small probability, which poses a typical Imbalanced Data Classification problem. Most previous studies mainly improved the prediction methods only in data level or algorithm level, which may be inadequate to predict the crash risk accurately especially in a continuous real-time traffic data environment. The comprehensive imbalanced classification algorithm was examined in this research to build more accurate real-time traffic crash risk prediction model. At the output level, the Youden index method has been proved to be of the best ability to divide the prediction results and Probability Calibration Method was proposed to optimize the prediction results in further. At the data level, Under-sampling and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique(SMOTE) methods were compared to solve the imbalanced data classification problem by changing the data distribution. At the algorithm level, the cost-sensitive MLP algorithm and Adaboost algorithm were examined and finally the random sampling cost-sensitive MLP model(RCSMLP) and Rusboost model were constructed by synthesizing the optimization methods from three levels. The sensitivity of the RCSMLP model reached 78.10 % and the specificity of the model reached 81.44 %. The AUC and sensitivity of the Rusboost model reached 0.892 and 0.842 while the specificity of the model reached 0.816, which shows the better performance in dealing with the imbalanced traffic crash risk prediction problem compared to existed prediction models. The proposed method of improving prediction accuracy in this study is universal and can be applied to many other prediction models to predict real-time traffic crash risk.}

Hence, providing accurate and timely prediction of the severity of traffic collisions at work zones is vital to reduce the response time for emergency units (e.g., medical aid), accordingly improve traffic safety and reduce congestion. In predicting the severity of traffic collisions, previous studies used different statistical and machine learning models with accuracy as the main evaluating factor. However, the performance of these models was generally not good, especially on fatal and injury crashes. Also, looking into the prediction accuracy only is misleading. This paper aims to propose a novel deep learning-based approach with a customized f1-loss function to predict the severity of traffic crashes. Underlying this objective is to compare the results of deep learning models with machine learning model considering two performance indicators, namely precision, and recall. The data used in the analysis include a sample of traffic crashes that occurred at work zones in Louisiana from 2014 to 2018. This dataset includes valuable information (features) related to road, vehicle, and human factors affecting the occurrence and severity of those crashes. The proposed methodology is based on transforming these features/variables into images. Image transformation is conducted using a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique t-SNE and convex hull algorithm. A CNN based deep learning algorithm with a customized loss function was used to directly optimize the model for precision and recall. The results showed improved performance in predicting the crash severity of fatal and injury crashes using the deep learning approach, which can help to improve traffic safety as well as traffic congestion at work zones and possibly other roadways segments.}

The approach consisted of applying unsupervised clustering algorithms to NASS-CDS crash data in order to classify seriously injured, belted occupants into clusters based on injured body regions, biomechanical characteristics and crash severity. Injury patterns in each cluster were analyzed and associated with other characteristics of the crash, such as the collision configuration. The groups of seriously injured occupants found in this research contain a large amount of information and research possibilities. The resulting clusters represent new opportunities for vehicle safety, which have been highlighted in this study.}

abstract = {Road crashes have become a leading cause of death in China. Although enormous efforts have been exerted to determine the factors that affect individual crash incidents, neighborhood-level crash incidence in Chinese cities has not been sufficiently analyzed. This study fills this gap by quantifying the effects of built environment factors on neighborhood-level automobile-involved crash density (NACD) in urban China and identifying its mediators and mediating effects. In American suburbs, urban sprawl is widely recognized to render neighborhoods unsafe for residence, thus leading to a high crash incidence. This study compares the characteristics of built environments between inner-city neighborhoods and the new neighborhoods that have been developed through China’s state-led suburbanization since 2008 to reveal how this suburbanization provides a safer neighborhood environment. A structural equation model is used to examine the relationships among suburbanization, built environment factors, and NACD in the city proper of Chengdu, the largest metropolis in southwest China. Thus, this study contributes new empirical evidence to the debates over urban designs that are safest for traffic. Moreover, this study enriches our understanding of different sociospatial consequences between American-style urban sprawl and China’s state-led suburbanization.}

abstract = {The identification of accident hot spots is a central task of road safety management. Bayesian count data models have emerged as the workhorse method for producing probabilistic rankings of hazardous sites in road networks. Typically, these methods assume simple linear link function specifications, which, however, limit the predictive power of a model. Furthermore, extensive specification searches are precluded by complex model structures arising from the need to account for unobserved heterogeneity and spatial correlations. Modern machine learning (ML) methods offer ways to automate the specification of the link function. However, these methods do not capture estimation uncertainty, and it is also difficult to incorporate spatial correlations. In light of these gaps in the literature, this paper proposes a new spatial negative binomial model which uses Bayesian additive regression trees to endogenously select the specification of the link function. Posterior inference in the proposed model is made feasible with the help of the Pólya-Gamma data augmentation technique. We test the performance of this new model on a crash count data set from a metropolitan highway network. The empirical results show that the proposed model performs at least as well as a baseline spatial count data model with random parameters in terms of goodness of fit and site ranking ability.}

Existing studies on takeover transitions have focused on drivers’ behavioral responses to takeover requests (TORs). As a complement, this exploratory study aimed to examine drivers’ psychophysiological responses to TORs as a result of varying non-driving-related tasks (NDRTs), traffic density and TOR lead time. A total number of 102 drivers were recruited and each of them experienced 8 takeover events in a high fidelity fixed-base driving simulator. Drivers’ gaze behaviors, heart rate (HR) activities, galvanic skin responses (GSRs), and facial expressions were recorded and analyzed during two stages. First, during the automated driving stage, we found that drivers had lower heart rate variability, narrower horizontal gaze dispersion, and shorter eyes-on-road time when they had a high level of cognitive load relative to a low level of cognitive load. Second, during the takeover transition stage, 4 s lead time led to inhibited blink numbers and larger maximum and mean GSR phasic activation compared to 7 s lead time, whilst heavy traffic density resulted in increased HR acceleration patterns than light traffic density. Our results showed that psychophysiological measures can indicate specific internal states of drivers, including their workload, emotions, attention, and situation awareness in a continuous, non-invasive and real-time manner. The findings provide additional support for the value of using psychophysiological measures in automated driving and for future applications in driver monitoring systems and adaptive alert systems.}

Two modeling techniques were explored, the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (COM-Poisson) model (to accommodate bicycle-vehicle crash under-dispersion) and a machine learning technique, the multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS). MARS is a non-black-box model and can effectively handle non-linear crash predictors and interactions. A total of 1,311 bicycle-vehicle crashes from 2011 through 2015 in Alabama were collected and their respective police reports were reviewed in details. Results from the SPFs for roadway segments using COM-Poisson showed that bicycle-vehicle crash frequencies were reduced along curved and downgrade/upgrade stretches and when having heavy traffic flow (along U2U segments). For urban signalized (USG) intersections, the absence of right-turn lanes on minor roads, the presence of bus stops, and the increase in the major road annual average daily traffic (AADT) were significant factors contributing to the increase in the number of bicycle-vehicle crashes. However, the presence of divided medians on major approaches was found to reduce bicycle-vehicle crashes at USG and UST intersections. MARS outperformed the corresponding COM-Poisson models for all five facilities based on mean absolute deviance (MAD), mean square prediction error (MSPE), and generalized R-square. MARS is recommended as a promising technique for effectively predicting bicycle-vehicle crashes on segments and intersections.}

abstract = {Road crashes impose an important burden on health and the economy. Numerous efforts have been undertaken to understand the factors that affect road collisions in general, and the severity of crashes in particular. In this literature several strategies have been proposed to model interactions between parties in a crash, including the use of variables regarding the other party (or parties) in the collision, data subsetting, and estimating models with hierarchical components. Since no systematic assessment has been conducted of the performance of these strategies, they appear to be used in an ad-hoc fashion in the literature. The objective of this paper is to empirically evaluate ways to model party interactions in the context of crashes involving two parties. To this end, a series of models are estimated using data from Canada's National Collision Database. Three levels of crash severity (no injury/injury/fatality) are analyzed using ordered probit models and covariates for the parties in the crash and the conditions of the crash. The models are assessed using predicted shares and classes of outcomes, and the results highlight the importance of considering opponent effects in crash severity analysis. The study also suggests that hierarchical (i.e., multi-level) specifications and subsetting do not necessarily perform better than a relatively simple single-level model with opponent-related factors. The results of this study provide insights regarding the performance of different modelling strategies, and should be informative to researchers in the field of crash severity.}

Three driving simulator experiment scenarios were developed to simulate the typical traffic and weather conditions on the rural Interstate 80 (I-80) in Wyoming. A total of 25 professional drivers from the WYDOT and trucking industry were recruited to participate in the driving simulator experiment. Participants’ instantaneous speeds at various locations were collected to reveal the effects of CV TIMs on their speed selection. The results showed that average speed profiles under CV scenarios were generally lower than under baseline scenarios, particularly for winter conditions (snowy and severe weather). The variance of speed under CV scenarios was found to be significantly lower than the baseline scenarios, indicating that CV TIMs have the potential to harmonize the variations in speed. In addition, for the work zone driving simulator experiment, this research revealed that the mean time-to-collision (TTC) under baseline scenario is approximately 40 % lower than CV scenario, and the mean deceleration to avoid a crash (DRAC) under baseline scenario is approximately 19.3 % higher than CV scenario. These findings suggest that CV TIMs can reduce the risk of crashes. Research findings would provide the WYDOT with early insights into the effectiveness of CV TIMs, which could assist with developing more efficient transportation management strategies under adverse weather conditions.}

Participants completed 12 lane-changing manoeuvres in three drives, categorised by degree of manual engagement with the driving task: Fully Manual Drive, Manual Intervention Required, Fully Automated Drive (Manual drive, Partial automation, Full automation). For Partial automation, drivers resumed control from the automated system and changed lane manually. For Full automation, the automated system managed the lane change, but participants initiated the manoeuvre by pulling the indicator lever. Results were compared to the Manual drive condition, where drivers controlled the vehicle at all times. For each driving condition, lane changing was initiated by drivers, at their discretion, in response to a slow-moving lead vehicle, which entered their lane. Failure to change lane did not result in a collision. To understand how different motor control requirements affected driver visual attention, eye movements to the road centre, and drivers' vertical and horizontal gaze dispersion were compared during different stages of the lane change manoeuvre, for the three drives. Results showed that drivers' attention to the road centre was generally lower for drives with less motor control requirements, especially when they were not engaged in the lane change process. However, as drivers moved closer to the lead vehicle, and prepared to change lane, the pattern of eye movements to the road centre converged, regardless of whether drivers were responsible for the manual control of the lane change. While there were no significant differences in horizontal gaze dispersion between the three drives, vertical dispersion for the two levels of automation was quite different, with higher dispersion during Partial automation, which was due to a higher reliance on the HMI placed in the centre console.}

Many previous studies on driving strategies mainly focused on the low-level detailed driving behaviors or specific traffic scenarios but lacked the high-level driving strategy studies. Though researchers showed increasing interest in driving strategies, there still has no comprehensive answer on how to proactively implement safe driving. After analyzing several representative driving strategies, we propose three characteristic dimensions that are important to measure driving strategies: preferred objective, risk appetite, and collaborative manner. According to these three characteristic dimensions, we categorize existing driving strategies of autonomous vehicles into four kinds: defensive driving strategies, competitive driving strategies, negotiated driving strategies, and cooperative driving strategies. This paper provides a timely comparative review of these four strategies and highlights the possible directions for improving the high-level driving strategy design.}

Modern instrumentation and computational resources allow for the monitorization of driver, vehicle, and roadway/environment to extract leading indicators of crashes from multi-dimensional data streams. To quantify variations that are beyond normal in driver behavior and vehicle kinematics, the concept of volatility is applied. The study measures driver-vehicle volatilities using the naturalistic driving data. By integrating and fusing multiple real-time streams of data, i.e., driver distraction, vehicular movements and kinematics, and instability in driving, this study aims to predict occurrence of safety critical events and generate appropriate feedback to drivers and surrounding vehicles. The naturalistic driving data is used which contains 7566 normal driving events, and 1315 severe events (i.e., crash and near-crash), vehicle kinematics, and driver behavior collected from more than 3500 drivers. In order to capture the local dependency and volatility in time-series data 1D-Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and 1DCNN-LSTM are applied. Vehicle kinematics, driving volatility, and impaired driving (in terms of distraction) are used as the input parameters. The results reveal that the 1DCNN-LSTM model provides the best performance, with 95.45% accuracy and prediction of 73.4% of crashes with a precision of 95.67%. Additional features are extracted with the CNN layers and temporal dependency between observations is addressed, which helps the network learn driving patterns and volatile behavior. The model can be used to monitor driving behavior in real-time and provide warnings and alerts to drivers in low-level automated vehicles, reducing their crash risk.}

abstract = {Accurate detection of traffic accidents as well as condition analysis are essential to effectively restoring traffic flow and reducing serious injuries and fatalities. This goal can be obtained using an advanced data classification model with a rich source of traffic information. Several systems based on sensors and social networking platforms have been presented recently to detect traffic events and monitor traffic conditions. However, sensor-based systems provide limited information, and may fail owing to the long detection times and high false-alarm rates. In addition, social networking data are unstructured, unpredictable, and contain idioms, jargon, and dynamic topics. The machine learning algorithms utilized for traffic event detection might not extract valuable information from social networking data. In this paper, a social network–based, real-time monitoring framework is proposed for traffic accident detection and condition analysis using ontology and latent Dirichlet allocation (OLDA) and bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM). First, the query-based search engine effectively collects traffic information from social networks, and the data preprocessing module transforms it into structured form. Second, the proposed OLDA-based topic modeling method automatically labels each sentence (e.g., traffic or non-traffic) to identify the exact traffic information. In addition, the ontology-based event recognition approach detects traffic events from traffic-related data. Next, the sentiment analysis technique identifies the polarity of traffic events employing user’s opinions, which helps determine accurate conditions of traffic events. Finally, the FastText model and Bi-LSTM with softmax regression are trained for traffic event detection and condition analysis. The proposed framework is evaluated using traffic-related data, comparing OLDA and Bi-LSTM with existing topic modeling methods and traditional classifiers using word embedding models, respectively. Our system outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves accuracy of 97 %. This finding demonstrates that the proposed system is more efficient for traffic event detection and condition analysis, in comparison to other existing systems.}

Marginal effects for ATM deployments that featured hard shoulder running (HSR) revealed lower likelihoods for severe and moderate injury crashes of 15.9 % and for minor injury crashes of 10.1 %. The likelihood of severe and moderate injury crashes and minor injury crashes reduced by 12.4 % and 8.33 % with ATM without HSR.

More specifically, the mediation model of driver characteristics on risky driving behaviors moderated by gender is constructed by the SEM. The results show that the effects of driving experience on risky driving behaviors are partially mediated by sensation seeking and risk perception for male drivers, while those are completely mediated by sensation seeking and risk perception for female drivers. Moreover, the development trend of risky driving behavior engagements declines greater with the growing of driving experience for female drivers than male drivers. Finally, a classification model of the driver’s driving risk is proposed by the Random Forest classifier, in which the driving risk level of the driver evaluated by the crash and near-crash rate could be classified through the driver’s self-reported demographics, sensation seeking, risk perception, and risky driving behaviors. The classification accuracy achieves up to 90 percent, which offers an alternative approach to identifying potential high-risk drivers to reduce property losses, injuries, and death caused by traffic accidents.}

The study aims to evaluate two main research topics. The first one is investigation of the effect of road infrastructure, road geometry, street, accident, atmospheric and cyclist related parameters on the classification of cyclist injury-severity similarly to other studies in the literature. The second one is examination of the performance of the new fuzzy decision approaches described in detail in this study for the classification of cyclist injury-severity. For this purpose, the data set containing bicycle-vehicle accidents in 2013–2017 was analyzed with the classic C4.5 algorithm and two different hybrid fuzzy decision mechanisms, namely DT-based converted FL (DT-CFL) and novel DT-based revised FL (DT-RFL). The model performances were compared according to their accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure values. The results indicated that the parameters that have the greatest effect on the injury-severity in bicycle-vehicle accidents are gender, vehicle damage-extent, road-type as well as the highly effective parameters such as pavement type, accident type, and vehicle-movement. The most successful classification performance among the three models was achieved by the DT-RFL model with 72.0 % F-measure and 69.96 % Accuracy. With 59.22 % accuracy and %57.5 F-measure values, the DT-CFL model, rules of which were created according to the splitting criteria of C4.5 algorithm, gave worse results in the classification of the injury-severity in bicycle-vehicle accidents than the classical C4.5 algorithm. In light of these results, the use of fuzzy decision mechanism models presented in this study on more comprehensive datasets is recommended for further studies.}

abstract = {Driving automation systems (e.g., SAE Level 2) ultimately aim to enhance the comfort and safety of drivers. At present, these systems are able to control some portions of the driving task (e.g., braking, steering) for extended time periods, giving drivers the opportunity to disengage from the responsibilities associated with driving. In this study, data derived from two naturalistic driving studies involving automation-equipped vehicles were analyzed to evaluate driver behaviors with respect to driving automation system use, specifically distraction-related factors (i.e., secondary task engagement, eye-glance behavior, and drowsiness). The results indicate that when drivers had prior experience using driving automation systems, they were almost two times as likely to participate in distracted driving behaviors when the systems were active than during manual driving. Drivers with less experience and familiarity with driving automation systems were less likely to drive distracted when the systems were active; however, these drivers tended to be somewhat drowsy when driving with systems activated. The results provide important insights into different operational phases of driving automation system use (i.e., learning/unfamiliar vs experienced users), whereby experience results in overtrust and overreliance on the advanced technologies, which subsequently may negate some of the safety benefits of these systems. Thus, while the safety benefits of driving automation systems are evident, it is imperative to better understand the impact these advanced technologies may have on driver behavior and performance in order to evaluate and address any unintended consequences associated with system use.}

abstract = {Objective
The paper presents a systematic analysis of drivers’ crash avoidance response during crashes and near-crashes and developed a machine learning-based predictive model that can determine driver maneuver using pre-incident driver behavior and driving context.
Methods
We analyzed 286 naturalistic rear-end crashes and near-crashes from the SHRP2 naturalistic driving study. All the events were manually reduced using face video (face and forward) and kinematic responses. In this paper, we developed new reduction variables that enhanced the understanding of drivers’ gaze behavior and roadway attention behavior during these events. These features reflected how the event criticality, measured using time to collision, related to drivers’ pre-incident behavior (secondary behavior, gaze behavior), and drivers’ perception of the event (physical reaction and maneuver). The imperative understanding of such relations was validated using a random forest- (RF) based classifier, which efficiently predicted if a driver was going to brake or change the lane as an avoidance maneuver.
Results
The RF presented in this paper effectively explored the nonlinear patterns in the data and was highly accurate (∼96 %) in its prediction. A further analysis of the RF model showed that six features played a pivotal role in the decision logic. These included the drivers’ last glance duration before the event, last glance eccentricity, duration of ‘eyes on road’ immediately before the event, the time instance and criticality when the driver perceives the threat as well as acknowledge the threat, and possibility of an escape path in the adjacent lane. Using partial dependency plots, we also showed how different thresholds of these feature variables determined the drivers’ maneuver intention.
Conclusions
In this paper we analyzed driving context, drivers’ behavior, event criticality, and drivers’ response in a unified structure to predict their avoidance response. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such effort where large-scale naturalistic data (crashes and near crashes) was analyzed for prediction of drivers’ maneuver and determined key behavioral and contextual factors that contribute to this avoidance maneuver.}

This study is designed to identify the AV safety quantification studies, evaluate the quantification approaches used in the literature, and uncover the gaps and challenges in AV safety evaluation. We employed a scoping review methodology to identify the approaches used in the literature to quantify AV safety. After screening and reviewing the literature, six approaches were identified: target crash population, traffic simulation, driving simulator, road test data analysis, system failure risk assessment, and safety effectiveness estimation. We ran two evaluations on the identified approaches. First, we investigated each approach in terms of its input (required data, assumptions, etc.), output (safety evaluation metrics), and application (to estimate AVs' safety implications at the vehicle, transportation system, and society levels). Second, we qualitatively compared them in terms of three criteria: availability of input data, suitability for evaluating different automation levels, and reliability of estimations. This review identifies four challenges in AV safety evaluation: (a) shortcomings in AV safety evaluation approaches, (b) uncertainties in AV implementations and their impacts on AV safety, (c) potential riskier behavior of AV passengers as well as other road users, and (d) emerging safety issues related to AV implementations. This review is expected to help researchers and rulemakers to choose the most appropriate quantification method based on their goals and study limitations. Future research is required to address the identified challenges in AV safety evaluation.}

Based on the framework, a set of algorithms are developed which are capable of detecting various traffic pre-events from traffic videos, such as speed violation, one-way traffic, overtaking, illegal parking, and wrong drop-off location of passengers. After detecting the pre-events, an alarm will be automatically generated in the control room which helps to take precautionary measures to avoid any potential mishap on road, thereby, improving the road safety. In previous studies, a single system can handle either one or two pre-events. Whereas, in our present study, five anomalies can be detected in a single system using five different algorithms. Our study further contributes to the detection of “wrong drop-off location of passengers”. The effectiveness of the developed algorithms is demonstrated over 132 traffic videos acquired from an integrated plant in India. Some additional comparative studies for overtaking and illegal parking are done using two benchmark datasets, namely ‘CamSeq01’ and ‘ISLab-PVD’. Through an extensive study, it can be concluded that our developed algorithms are superior to some state-of-the-art algorithms in the detection of pre-events on road.}

Most of the previous intersection safety studies are conducted based on static and highly aggregated data such as average daily traffic and crash frequency. The aggregated data may result in unreliable findings because they are based on averages and might not necessarily represent the actual conditions at the time of the crash. This study uses real-time event-based detection records, and crash data to develop predictive models for the vehicle occupants' injury severity. The three-year (2017–2019) data were acquired from the arterial highways in the City of Tallahassee, Florida. Random Forest (RF) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) classifiers were used to identify the important factors on the vehicle occupants' injury severity prediction. The performance comparison of the two classifiers revealed that the XGBoost has a higher balanced accuracy score than RF. Using the XGBoost classifier, five topmost influential factors on injury prediction were identified. The factors are the manner of the collision, through and right-turn traffic volume, arrival on red for through and right-turn traffic, split failure for through traffic, and delays for through and right-turn traffic. Moreover, the partial dependency plots of the influential variables are presented to reveal their impact on vehicle occupant injury prediction. The knowledge gained from this study will be useful in developing effective proactive countermeasures to mitigate intersection-related crash injuries in real-time.}

To address this challenge, we aimed to predict drivers’ takeover performance before the issue of a takeover request (TOR) by analyzing drivers’ physiological data and external environment data. We used data sets from two human-in-the-loop experiments, wherein drivers engaged in non-driving-related tasks (NDRTs) were requested to take over control from automated driving in various situations. Drivers’ physiological data included heart rate indices, galvanic skin response indices, and eye-tracking metrics. Driving environment data included scenario type, traffic density, and TOR lead time. Drivers’ takeover performance was categorized as good or bad according to their driving behaviors during the transition period and was treated as the ground truth. Using six machine learning methods, we found that the random forest classifier performed the best and was able to predict drivers’ takeover performance when they were engaged in NDRTs with different levels of cognitive load. We recommended 3 s as the optimal time window to predict takeover performance using the random forest classifier, with an accuracy of 84.3% and an F1-score of 64.0%. Our findings have implications for the algorithm development of driver state detection and the design of adaptive in-vehicle alert systems in conditionally automated driving.}

abstract = {Speeding is considered as one of the most significant contributing factors to severe traffic crashes. Understanding the associations between trip/driving/roadways features and speeding behavior is crucial for both researchers and practitioners. This research utilized naturalistic driving data collected by the Safety Pilot Model Deployment (SPMD) program and roadway features from a road inventory dataset - Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS), provided by the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT), to investigate the hidden rules that associated trip/driving/roadway features with speeding behavior. A classification-based association (CBA) algorithm was adopted to explore the hidden rules from two perspectives of speeding: speeding duration and speeding pattern. Results indicate that the combinations of longer trips (more than 60 min), driving on the roadways with a relatively higher functional class are highly associated with longer speeding events (speeding longer than 2 min). The moderate speeding events (speeding longer than 2 min and longer than 30 s) are found highly associated with the combination of driving on roadways with lower functional class, absence of a median and relatively short trip time (less than 30 min). The research also found the combinations of driving on roadways with relatively lower functional class, experienced congestion before a speeding event, and the presence of a median is a leading cause that triggers a higher speeding pattern (speeding more than 5mph above the speed limit). Furthermore, the moderate speeding pattern (speeding more than 1mph above the speed limit and less than 5mph of the speed limit) is associated with the combinations of factors like experiencing congestion before a speed event, driving on roadways with higher functional class and a relatively shorter trip (less than 30 min). The findings can help practitioners understand the composite effect of these factors more comprehensively and provide corresponding countermeasures to mitigate the negative consequences of speeding wherever possible. These can also help in calibrating driver behavior parameters for transportation-related simulation tools.}

The driver’s behavior is characterized by his or her driving style and plays an important role in traffic safety. This paper proposes a novel framework to classify driving styles (defined as aggressive, normal, and cautious) based on online car-hailing data to investigate the distinct characteristics of drivers when performing various driving tasks (defined as cruising, ride requests, and drop-off) and undergoing certain maneuvers (defined as turning, acceleration, and deceleration). The proposed model is constructed based on the detection and classification of driving maneuvers using a threshold-based endpoint detection approach, principal component analysis, and k-means clustering. The driving styles that the driver exhibits for the different driving tasks are compared and analyzed based on the classified maneuvers. The empirical results for Nanjing, China demonstrate that the proposed framework can detect driving maneuvers and classify driving styles accurately. Moreover, according to this framework, driving tasks lead to variations in driving style, and the variations in driving style during the different driving tasks differ significantly for turning, acceleration, and deceleration maneuvers.}

The increasingly abundant crowdsourcing data and floating car data provide new support for improving traffic accident management. This paper investigates the methods to predict the complicated behavior of traffic flow evolution after traffic accidents using crowdsourcing data. Based on the available data source, the traffic condition is divided into four levels by congestion delay index: severely congested, congested, slow moving and uncongested. Four types of accidents are consequently defined based on the occurrence of each level. A hierarchical scheme is designed for identifying the most congested level and sequentially predicting duration of each level. The proposed model is validated using traffic accident data in 2017 from an anonymous source in Beijing, China by embedding three machine learning algorithms, random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM) and neural network (NN), in the scheme. The results show NN outperforms the other two models when the assessment is conducted in absolute differences. Meanwhile, RF has a slightly better performance than SVM, especially when predicting the short-period congestion of severely congested level at the first time. By continuously updating the traffic condition information, significant improvement in accuracy can be acquired regardless of the exact model used. This study shows that emerging crowdsourcing data can be used in a real-time analysis of traffic accidents and the proposed model is effective to analyze such data.}

Developing a real-time continuous lane change detection system can assist drivers to perform and deal with complex driving tasks or provide assistance when it is needed the most. This study proposed trajectory-level lane change detection models based on features from vehicle kinematics, machine vision, roadway characteristics, and driver demographics under different weather conditions. To develop the models, the SHRP2 Naturalistic Driving Study (NDS) and Roadway Information Database (RID) datasets were utilized. Initially, descriptive statistics were utilized to investigate the lane change behavior, which revealed significant differences among different weather conditions for most of the parameters. Six data fusion categories were introduced for the first time, considering different data availability. In order to select relevant features in each category, Boruta, a wrapper-based algorithm was employed. The lane change detection models were trained, validated, and comparatively evaluated using four Machine Learning algorithms including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and eXtrem Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). The results revealed that the highest overall detection accuracy was found to be 95.9 % using the XGBoost model when all the features were included in the model. Moreover, the highest overall detection accuracy of 81.9 % using the RF model was achieved considering only vehicle kinematics-based features, indicating that the proposed model could be utilized when other data are not available. Furthermore, the analysis of the impact of weather conditions on lane change detection suggested that incorporating weather could improve the accuracy of lane change detection. In addition, the analysis of early lane change detection indicated that the proposed algorithm could predict the lane changes within 5 s before the vehicles cross the lane line. The developed detection models could be used to monitor and control driver behavior in a Cooperative Automated Vehicle environment.}

abstract = {Road accidents are globally accepted challenges. They are one of the significant causes of deaths and injuries besides other direct and indirect losses. Countries and international organizations have designed technologies, systems, and policies to prevent accidents. However, hit-and-run accidents remain one of the most dangerous types of road accidents as the information about the vehicle responsible for the accident remain unknown. Therefore, any mechanism which can provide information about the impacting vehicle in hit-and-run accidents will be useful in planning and executing preventive measures to address this road menace. Since there exist several models to predict the impacting unknown vehicle, it becomes important to find which is the most accurate amongst those available. This research applies a process-based approach that identifies the most accurate model out of six supervised learning classification models viz. Logistic Reasoning, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Naïve Bayes, Classification and Regression Trees, k-Nearest Neighbor and Support Vector Machine. These models are implemented using five-fold and ten-fold cross validation, on road accident data collected from five mid-sized Indian cities: Agra, Amritsar, Bhopal, Ludhiana, and Vizag (Vishakhapatnam).This study investigates the possible input factors that may have effect on the performance of applied models. Based on the results of the experiment conducted in this study, Support Vector Machine has been found to have the maximum potentiality to predict unknown impacting vehicle type in hit-and-run accidents for all the cities except Amritsar. The result indicates that, Classification and Regression Trees have maximum accuracy, for Amritsar. Naïve Bayes performed very poorly for the five cities. These recommendations will help in predicting unknown impacting vehicles in hit-and-run accidents. The outcome is useful for transportation authorities and policymakers to implement effective road safety measures for the safety of road users.}

abstract = {Fatigue negatively affects the safety and performance of drivers on the road. In fact, drowsiness and fatigue are the cause of a substantial number of motor vehicle accidents. Drowsiness among the drivers can be detected using variety of modalities, including electroencephalogram (EEG), eye movement, and vehicle driving dynamics. Among these EEG is highly accurate but very intrusive and cumbersome. On the other hand, vehicle driving dynamics are very easy to acquire but accuracy is not very high. Eye movement based approach is very attractive in terms of balance between these two extremes. However, eye movement based techniques normally require an eye tracking device which consists of high speed camera with sophisticated algorithm to extract eye movement related parameters such as blinking, eye closure, saccades, fixation etc. This makes eye tracking based drowsiness detection difficult to implement as a practical system, especially on an embedded platform. In this paper, authors propose to use eye images from camera directly without the need for expensive eye-tracking system. Here, eye related movements are captured by Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to detect the drowsiness. Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) is a class of RNN which has several advantages over vanilla RNNs. In this work an array of LSTM cells are utilized to model the eye movements. Two types of LSTMs were employed: 1-D LSTM (R-LSTM) which is used as baseline and the convolutional LSTM (C-LSTM) which facilitates using 2-D images directly. Patches of size 48 × 48 around each eye were extracted from 38 subjects, participating in a simulated driving experiment. The state of vigilance among the subjects were independently assessed by power spectral analysis of multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, recorded simultaneously, and binary labels of alert and drowsy (baseline) were generated. Results show high efficacy of the proposed system. R-LSTM based approach resulted in accuracy around 82 % and C-LSTM based approach resulted in accuracy in the range of 95%–97%. Comparison is also provided with a recently published eye-tracking based approach, showing the proposed LSTM technique outperform with a wide margin.}
